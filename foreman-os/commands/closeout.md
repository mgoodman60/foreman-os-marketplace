# /closeout Command

Track project closeout deliverables, building systems commissioning, and warranty documentation. Manages closeout status from pre-substantial completion through final closeout and warranty management.

## Usage

```
/closeout [status | add | commission | warranty | checklist | generate]
```

---

## Step 1: Initialize Closeout Data

If this is the first use of the /closeout command on a project, initialize the closeout data file:

1. Read `/folder_mapping.ai_output` directory path from project configuration
2. Create `/folder_mapping.ai_output/closeout-data.json` if it does not exist
3. Initialize with template structure:
   ```json
   {
     "project_id": "[from project-data.json]",
     "project_name": "[from project-data.json]",
     "closeout_status": {
       "phase": "pre_substantial",
       "substantial_completion_date": null,
       "final_completion_date": null,
       "items": [],
       "retainage": {
         "total_held": 0,
         "released": 0,
         "remaining": 0,
         "conditions_for_release": []
       }
     },
     "commissioning": {
       "commissioning_agent": null,
       "systems": []
     },
     "warranties": {
       "standard_warranty_start": null,
       "warranties": []
     }
   }
   ```

---

## Command: `/closeout status`

Display current closeout status dashboard.

### Steps

1. Read `closeout-data.json` from `folder_mapping.ai_output`
2. Calculate completion metrics by category:
   - Count items by status (not_started, in_progress, submitted, approved, na)
   - Calculate percentage complete for each category (O&M, As-builts, Warranties, Training, Testing, Spare Parts, Keys, Certificates)
   - Identify any overdue items (due_date before today)

3. Display dashboard with:
   ```

## Data Integration

### Reads From:
- `closeout-data.json` (closeout and commissioning status)
- `punch-list.json` (punch list items and status)
- `inspection-log.json` (inspection results and dates)
- `directory.json` (contractor and subcontractor names, contact info)
- `specs-quality.json` (building systems, equipment lists)
- `folder_mapping.ai_output` (data storage location)

### Writes To:
- `closeout-data.json` (all closeout and commissioning updates)
- `/reports/Closeout-Status-[YYYY-MM-DD].docx` (generated reports)

### Save & Log:
- Update `project-config.json` version_history:
  ```
  [TIMESTAMP] | closeout | [sub-action] | [details]
  ```
- If project data changed significantly, regenerate `CLAUDE.md` to reflect the latest project state

### References:
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/closeout-commissioning/SKILL.md` — Skill documentation
- `closeout-checklist.md` — Master checklist reference
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/project-data/SKILL.md` — Project information
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/field-reference/SKILL.md` — System startup sequences

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Add All Standard Closeout Items
```
1. User runs: /closeout add
2. Display master checklist
3. User selects: "Initialize all standard items"
4. System loads all ~50 items from closeout-checklist.md
5. System substitutes contractor names from directory.json
6. System adds all items to closeout-data.json
7. Dashboard shows: 0/50 items complete (0%)
```

### Workflow 2: Track HVAC Commissioning
```
1. User runs: /closeout commission HVAC
2. Display HVAC system startup sequence (from field-reference)
3. User enters pre-functional test results (Pass/Fail/Conditional)
4. If conditional, user enters deficiencies
5. System advances phase to functional_testing
6. User schedules functional performance test date
7. Upon completion, system advances to integrated_testing phase
8. Final status shows commissioning complete when all phases pass
```

### Workflow 3: Generate Monthly Status Report
```
1. User runs: /closeout generate
2. System reads current status from all data files
3. System calculates completion percentages by category
4. System identifies critical path items and overdue items
5. System generates professional .docx report
6. Report saved to /reports/ folder
7. User can distribute to owner and PM
```

## Notes for Field Superintendent

- **Timing:** Start closeout tracking 60 days before expected substantial completion
- **Key Dates:** Track substantial completion date carefully; all warranty periods start from this date
- **Documentation:** Keep all testing reports, training records, and warranties organized in closeout binder
- **Owner Communication:** Update closeout status weekly during punch list period; communicate critical path items
- **Critical Items:** Focus on Fire Marshal approval, Elevator inspection, and final C.O. as these often delay project
- **Commissioning:** Coordinate with commissioning agent; ensure all systems tested and approved before owner turnover
- **Retainage:** Track retainage carefully; conditions for release must be met for final payment
