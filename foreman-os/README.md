# Foreman_OS

The superintendent's operating system. A complete construction field management toolkit powered by deep document intelligence.

## What it does

Foreman_OS extracts comprehensive intelligence from your project documents — plans, specs, schedules, contracts, sub lists, geotech reports, safety plans, and more — then puts that intelligence to work across every part of your daily workflow: daily reports, 3-week look-aheads, RFI/submittal management, weekly owner reports, material tracking, vendor sourcing, and construction schedule generation.

Upload your documents once. Everything gets smarter from there.

### Core Capabilities

- **Deep document intelligence** — Three-pass extraction pipeline (metadata → structure → targeted content) pulls grid lines, room schedules, spec requirements, weather thresholds, hold points, tolerances, schedule milestones, sub directories, safety zones, SWPPP requirements, and geotechnical data
- **Conversational field intake** — Log observations throughout the day in plain language. The chatbot classifies your input, resolves sub names and locations against project intelligence, and stores everything for report generation
- **Daily reports** — Professional PDFs with AI-powered language standardization, photo captioning, smart placement, spec enrichment, and automated QA
- **3-week look-ahead** — Auto-generated lookahead schedules populated with subs, activities, materials, weather forecasts, and blocker alerts
- **RFI preparation** — Draft RFIs with auto-filled drawing references, spec sections, grid lines, and project team info
- **Submittal review** — Cross-reference submittals against spec requirements with line-by-line compliance checking and professional review comments
- **Weekly owner reports** — Aggregate daily reports into polished weekly summaries for the owner/PM
- **Material & procurement tracking** — Full lifecycle from PO through delivery through spec verification and cert tracking
- **Vendor sourcing** — Find suppliers, maintain a vendor database, track quotes and capabilities
- **Construction schedules** — Generate formatted door, hardware, fixture, finish, plumbing, and equipment schedules from extracted plan data
- **Interactive dashboards** — Weekly and project-lifetime views with charts, milestone tracking, and a built-in data chat
- **Morning briefings** — Daily context with weather, schedule, carry-forward items, delivery alerts, and pending action items
- **Project memory** — Auto-generated CLAUDE.md file that keeps Claude current on your project across sessions

## Commands

### Project Setup

#### `/set-project [name]`
Initialize a new project. Collects project basics and accepts document uploads for deep intelligence extraction. Generates the project memory file (CLAUDE.md) for session continuity.

#### `/process-docs [filename, type, or "scan"]`
Process specific documents to extract intelligence. Point it at a file, a document type, or drag a file into the chat. Classifies automatically, extracts intelligence, and merges with existing project data. Use `/process-docs scan` to see what's new or changed in your project folders before processing.

### Daily Workflow

#### `/morning-brief`

## Getting Started

1. Install the plugin
2. Run `/set-project` to configure your project and upload key documents
3. Run `/morning-brief` each morning for your daily context
4. Use `/log` throughout the day as things happen on site
5. Run `/daily-report` to generate your report (it'll show a log summary first so you can fill gaps)
6. Run `/look-ahead` to plan the next 3 weeks
7. Run `/process-docs` any time new project docs come in (use `/process-docs scan` to check for changes)
8. Run `/dashboard` to see how the project is trending
9. Run `/weekly-report` at the end of each week for the owner

## How Project Intelligence Works

When you upload project documents during `/set-project` or `/process-docs`, the plugin runs a three-pass extraction pipeline:

1. **Metadata extraction** — Reads PDF properties (creator app, title, dates) to auto-classify the document type
2. **Structural analysis** — Scans for sheet indices, tables of contents, and table headers to confirm type and guide extraction
3. **Targeted content extraction** — Pulls specific intelligence based on document type, exhaustively — every schedule, every note, every detail

This intelligence is used by every command in the system:

- `/log` resolves sub names, fills in grid lines, adds spec references
- `/daily-report` enriches narratives with locations, thresholds, hold points
- `/look-ahead` maps activities to subs, materials, and weather constraints
- `/prepare-rfi` auto-fills drawing and spec references
- `/submittal-review` pulls spec requirements for compliance checking
- `/material-tracker` verifies deliveries against spec requirements
- `/schedules` generates formatted trade schedules from extracted data
- `/morning-brief` checks weather against thresholds, flags upcoming deliveries

The more documents you upload, the smarter everything gets.

## Project Memory (CLAUDE.md)

Foreman_OS generates a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project directory that serves as working memory across sessions. It contains a snapshot of your project basics, current status, key intelligence, active issues, and available commands. This file is auto-updated whenever project data changes, so Claude always knows where things stand when you start a new conversation.
