## 1. LEED Overview for Construction Teams

### What the Superintendent Needs to Know

LEED certification is a whole-building rating system, but **several credits depend directly on construction-phase activities**. The superintendent does not manage the full LEED submittal — that is the LEED coordinator's role. However, the superintendent is responsible for **field compliance and documentation** for the following credit categories:

- **Sustainable Sites (SS)**: Erosion and sedimentation control
- **Materials & Resources (MR)**: Waste management and product documentation
- **Indoor Environmental Quality (EQ)**: IAQ management, low-emitting materials, dust control
- **Water Efficiency (WE)**: Construction water management (irrigation, dewatering)

### LEED Project Roles

| Role | Responsibility | Typical Person |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| LEED Coordinator | Overall certification management, submittals to GBCI | Sustainability consultant or owner's rep |
| Project Manager | Budget for LEED requirements, contract compliance | GC PM |
| Superintendent | Field compliance, documentation, photo evidence | GC Superintendent |
| Subcontractors | Material compliance, product data sheets | Trade contractors |
| Commissioning Agent | Building systems verification | Third-party CxA |

### Documentation Responsibility Matrix

| Document | Created By | Collected By | Filed By |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| SWPPP inspection reports | Superintendent | Superintendent | LEED Coordinator |
| Waste weight tickets | Hauler | Superintendent | LEED Coordinator |
| Waste diversion report | Superintendent | Superintendent | LEED Coordinator |
| Product data sheets (VOC) | Manufacturer | Subcontractor | Superintendent + LEED Coordinator |
| IAQ management photos | Superintendent | Superintendent | LEED Coordinator |
| EPD/HPD documentation | Manufacturer | PM/Submittal Coordinator | LEED Coordinator |
| Construction IAQ test results | Testing lab | Superintendent | LEED Coordinator |
| Commissioning reports | CxA | CxA | LEED Coordinator |

## 2. Prerequisites (Required for ALL LEED Projects)

### MR Prerequisite: Storage and Collection of Recyclables

**Requirement**: Provide dedicated area for collection and storage of recyclable materials for the entire building.

**Super's Role**:
- Coordinate location of recycling area per architectural plans
- Verify signage and container placement during finishes phase
- Document in punch list if missing

### MR Prerequisite: Construction & Demolition Waste Management Planning

**Requirement**: Develop a construction waste management plan that identifies at minimum five materials (structural and non-structural) targeted for diversion.

**Waste Management Plan Template**:

```
CONSTRUCTION WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN

Project: [Project Name]
LEED Target: [Certification Level]
Diversion Target: [50% / 75%]
Date: [Date]
Prepared By: [Superintendent Name]

1. WASTE STREAMS IDENTIFIED:
   a. Concrete/Masonry — Diversion Method: On-site crushing or haul to recycler
   b. Metals (ferrous/non-ferrous) — Diversion Method: Scrap metal recycler
   c. Wood (clean dimensional lumber) — Diversion Method: Biomass or reuse
   d. Drywall (clean gypsum board) — Diversion Method: Gypsum recycler
   e. Cardboard/Paper — Diversion Method: Paper recycling
   f. Plastic (clean film/rigid) — Diversion Method: Plastic recycler
   g. Asphalt/Roofing — Diversion Method: Asphalt recycler

2. DIVERSION STRATEGY:
   ☐ On-site segregation (separate containers per material)
   ☐ Commingled — single hauler to certified C&D recycling facility
   ☐ Hybrid (metals and cardboard separated; remainder commingled)

3. HAULER INFORMATION:
   Company: [Name]
   Facility: [Name and Address]
   Recycling Certification: [Permit Number]
   Documented Diversion Rate: [%]

4. TRACKING METHOD:
   - Monthly weight tickets from hauler
   - Monthly diversion rate calculation
   - Cumulative project tracking spreadsheet

5. SITE SETUP:
   - Container locations marked on site logistics plan
   - Signage: Material type, "RECYCLE" or "LANDFILL"
   - Worker orientation includes waste segregation training

6. REPORTING:
   - Monthly report to LEED coordinator
   - Final project waste diversion summary for LEED submittal

Approved By: _______________    Date: __________
```

### EQ Prerequisite: Minimum Indoor Air Quality Performance

**Requirement**: Meet ASHRAE 62.1-2010 ventilation requirements. This is primarily a design requirement, but construction impacts include:
- Do not block outdoor air intakes during construction
- Verify ductwork connections per design before startup
- Support commissioning agent in ventilation verification

---

## 3. Construction-Phase Credits — Detailed Guide

### SS Credit: Construction Activity Pollution Prevention (1 point)

**Requirement**: Create and implement an erosion and sedimentation control plan for all construction activities.

**Documentation Checklist**:
- [ ] SWPPP document on-site and available for review
- [ ] NOI filed and permit number posted
- [ ] Weekly SWPPP inspection reports (with photos)
- [ ] Post-storm inspection reports (within 24 hours of 0.25" rain)
- [ ] Corrective action records with photos showing repair
- [ ] BMP maintenance log
- [ ] Final stabilization documentation for NOT

**Common Audit Findings**:
1. Missing inspection reports (gaps in weekly schedule)
2. No post-storm inspections documented
3. Photos without date stamps or location reference
4. Corrective actions not documented to closure
5. SWPPP not updated when site conditions changed

**Superintendent Tips**:
- Set a recurring calendar reminder for weekly inspections
- Use a smartphone for date-stamped photos during inspections
- Keep a running corrective action log — close items quickly
- Update SWPPP site map when BMP locations change

### MR Credit: C&D Waste Management (1-2 points)

**Points Available**:

| Option | Threshold | Points |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Option 1: Diversion | 50% diversion by weight or volume | 1 point |
| Option 1: Diversion | 75% diversion by weight or volume | 2 points |
| Option 2: Waste reduction | Generate < 2.5 lbs per SF | 2 points |

**Documentation Checklist**:
- [ ] Waste management plan (see template above)
- [ ] Monthly weight tickets from all haulers
- [ ] Monthly diversion rate calculations
- [ ] Cumulative project diversion tracking
- [ ] Hauler recycling facility certifications
- [ ] Photos of on-site segregation setup
- [ ] Final project waste summary report

**Common Pitfalls**:
1. Not collecting weight tickets from every haul (missing data = landfill assumed)
2. Hauler does not provide material-specific weights (commingled loads hard to verify)
3. Drywall contamination (painted or taped drywall may not be accepted by recycler)
4. Wood treated with CCA (chromated copper arsenate) not recyclable — must be landfilled
5. Starting waste tracking late — should begin Day 1 of construction

**Cost Comparison (Segregation vs. Commingled)**:

| Factor | On-Site Segregation | Commingled |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| Container rental | Higher (4-6 containers) | Lower (1-2 containers) |
| Hauling frequency | More pickups (smaller loads) | Fewer pickups |
| Tipping fee per ton | Lower ($25-50/ton recycled) | Higher ($50-80/ton processing) |
| Metal revenue | Yes (scrap value) | Facility keeps revenue |
| Achievable diversion | 75-95% | 50-70% |
| Worker training needed | More | Less |
| Site space required | More | Less |

### EQ Credit: Construction IAQ Management (1 point)

**Option 1: During Construction (SMACNA)**

**Documentation Checklist**:
- [ ] IAQ management plan written and distributed
- [ ] HVAC protection: photos of sealed duct openings before and during construction
- [ ] Material storage: photos showing absorptive materials protected from moisture
- [ ] Source control: low-VOC products tracked and verified
- [ ] Housekeeping: photos of clean work areas, HEPA vacuuming
- [ ] Pathway protection: photos of floor/wall protection
- [ ] Filter management: photo of MERV-8 filters during construction; replacement schedule

**Option 2: Before Occupancy (IAQ Testing or Flush-Out)**

**Flush-Out Procedure**:
```
CONSTRUCTION IAQ FLUSH-OUT

Requirements:
  - After all finishes installed, before occupancy
  - Total: 14,000 cubic feet of outdoor air per square foot of floor area
  - Minimum 3,500 CF/SF before occupancy; complete 14,000 CF/SF within 60 days
  - Internal temperature maintained at minimum 60 degrees F
  - Relative humidity not to exceed 60%

Calculation:
  Building area: 10,000 SF
  Required outdoor air: 10,000 x 14,000 = 140,000,000 CF total
  AHU outdoor air capacity: 5,000 CFM
  Time needed: 140,000,000 / 5,000 = 28,000 minutes = 467 hours = ~19.5 days (24/7 operation)

Documentation:
  - Start date, end date, total hours of fan operation
  - Temperature and humidity logs (daily readings minimum)
  - Fan CFM verification (balancing report or spot check)
  - Outdoor air damper position documentation (100% open)
```

**IAQ Testing Procedure (Alternative to Flush-Out)**:

| Contaminant | Maximum Concentration | Test Method |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Formaldehyde | 27 ppb | EPA TO-11A |
| Total VOCs (TVOC) | 500 ug/m3 | EPA TO-17 or ISO 16000-6 |
| Carbon monoxide | 9 ppm | EPA Method IP-3 |
| PM10 | 50 ug/m3 | EPA Method IP-10A |
| 4-Phenylcyclohexene (4-PCH) | 6.5 ug/m3 | EPA TO-17 (only if carpet installed) |

**Testing Protocol**:
- Test after construction complete, HVAC running for minimum 24 hours
- All interior finishes installed (paint, flooring, cabinetry)
- Doors and windows closed during testing
- Sampling locations per LEED requirements (at least 1 per 25,000 SF)
- Re-test any spaces that fail initial testing

### EQ Credit: Low-Emitting Materials (1-3 points)

**Product Categories and VOC Limits**:

| Category | Budget Threshold | Compliant Products |
|----------|------------------|--------------------|
| Interior paints and coatings | 90% of products by cost | Products meeting GS-11 or SCAQMD 1113 |
| Adhesives and sealants | 90% of products by cost | Products meeting SCAQMD 1168 |
| Flooring | 100% of floor area | FloorScore, GreenLabel Plus, or CDPH v1.2 |
| Composite wood | 100% of composite wood | CARB Phase 2 or no added urea-formaldehyde |
| Ceilings and walls | 90% of area | Products meeting CDPH v1.2 emissions testing |
| Thermal and acoustic insulation | 90% by cost | Products meeting CDPH v1.2 |
| Furniture (if included) | 90% by cost | BIFMA e3, ANSI/BIFMA X7.1, or Greenguard Gold |

**Tracking Spreadsheet Template**:

| Product | Manufacturer | Category | VOC (g/L) | Limit (g/L) | Compliant? | Area/Cost | Data Sheet Filed |
|---------|-------------|----------|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| ProMar 200 Flat | Sherwin-Williams | Paint (flat) | 45 | 50 | Yes | $2,400 | Yes |
| PL Premium | Loctite | Construction adhesive | 80 | 100 | Yes | $350 | Yes |
| Armstrong VCT | Armstrong | Flooring | — | FloorScore | Yes | 5,000 SF | Yes |

**Superintendent Action Items**:
1. Reject non-compliant products BEFORE installation — cheaper than replacement
2. Photograph product labels showing VOC content
3. Collect TDS/SDS from every subcontractor using interior products
4. Verify composite wood products have CARB compliance stamp
5. Maintain running spreadsheet — update weekly

## 4. Submittal Timing and Deadlines

### LEED Documentation Timeline

| Phase | Documentation Due | Responsible |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Pre-Construction | Waste management plan, IAQ management plan, SWPPP | Superintendent |
| Monthly (During Construction) | Waste weight tickets, diversion reports, SWPPP inspections, IAQ photos | Superintendent |
| Product Installation | VOC tracking log, EPD/HPD collection, product data sheets | Superintendent + Subs |
| Pre-Occupancy | IAQ testing or flush-out documentation, final filter installation | Superintendent |
| Closeout | Final waste diversion report, LEED photo package, all documentation compiled | Superintendent + LEED Coordinator |

### Critical Deadlines

- **Waste tracking**: Must begin Day 1 of construction. Gaps in data cannot be reconstructed.
- **Product VOC verification**: Must occur BEFORE installation. Non-compliant products installed = credit at risk.
- **SWPPP inspections**: Weekly schedule with no gaps. One missed week can jeopardize credit.
- **IAQ testing**: Schedule 2-3 weeks before occupancy to allow for re-testing if needed.
- **LEED documentation package**: Compile at least 30 days before anticipated certification submittal.

## 5. Common LEED Audit Findings on Construction Projects

### Top 10 Reasons Construction Credits Are Denied

1. **Incomplete waste tracking** — missing months of weight tickets
2. **No hauler certification** — cannot verify diversion claims
3. **VOC documentation gaps** — products installed without data sheets
4. **SWPPP inspection gaps** — missed weekly or post-storm inspections
5. **IAQ management not documented** — SMACNA followed but no photos
6. **Non-compliant product installed** — high-VOC paint or adhesive used
7. **Composite wood without CARB compliance** — no documentation
8. **Flush-out insufficient** — temperature or duration not met
9. **IAQ testing failed** — high formaldehyde from composite wood or finishes
10. **EPD/HPD not collected** — products had declarations but were not filed

### Audit Recovery Strategies

| Issue | Recovery Action | Likelihood of Success |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|
| Missing waste tickets (1-2 months) | Contact hauler for duplicate tickets | High |
| Missing waste tickets (>3 months) | Estimate from hauler records; provide narrative | Medium |
| Non-compliant product installed | Test for emissions compliance (CDPH v1.2) | Medium (expensive) |
| SWPPP inspection gaps | Provide narrative explanation; not recoverable for credit | Low |
| IAQ test failure | Flush-out, re-test; identify and remove source | High (with time) |

3. **Context**: Wide shot showing location, then close-up showing detail
4. **Legibility**: Ensure labels, text, and numbers are readable in photo
5. **Naming convention**: `LEED-[Credit]-[Date]-[Sequence].jpg` (e.g., `LEED-MR-WM-2026-02-15-001.jpg`)
6. **Filing**: Organize by credit category in project folder
7. **Frequency**: Minimum weekly for each active credit; more during critical activities
