    },
    ...
  ],
  action_items: ["AI-0001", "AI-0002", ...],        # References to action item IDs

### Action Item Object
```
{
  id: "AI-0001",                           # Auto-assigned, sequential, never reset
  description: "Review final mechanical submittal and approve",
  assignee: "Tom Jones",

}
```

### Meeting Log (Project-Level)
```
{
  project_id: "PRJ-2024-001",
  meetings: [
    { Meeting Object },
    { Meeting Object },
    ...
  ],
  last_meeting_date: "2025-02-17"
}
```

### Action Item Log (Project-Level)
```
{
  project_id: "PRJ-2024-001",
  items: [
    { Action Item Object },
    { Action Item Object },
    ...
  ],
  open_count: 23,
  overdue_count: 3,
  closed_count: 145
}
```

## Carry-Forward Logic

### Automatic Carry-Forward
When creating a new meeting:
1. Load all action items with status in ["open", "in_progress"]
2. Filter by created_meeting <= previous_meeting_id
3. Present to user with context: due date, assignee, description
4. For each item, ask: "Still open? (yes/no/deferred/completed)"
5. If completed: update status = "closed", closed_meeting = current meeting_id
6. If deferred: capture new due date and notes
7. If still open: capture status update in notes
8. Store updated items in action_item_log
9. Link carry-forward items to current meeting via carry_forward_items[]

### Overdue Item Highlighting
- Any action item with due_date < today AND status in ["open", "in_progress"]
- Flagged with visual indicator (red, bold)
- Surfaced in morning brief automatically
- Requires status update or new due date during meeting

## .docx Generation

- Carry-forward items marked with "CF" badge

### Carry-Forward Summary (if applicable)

```

## Storage Locations

### Document Output
```
folder_mapping.oac_reports / "meeting_minutes" / "meeting_minutes_MTG-001_2025-02-17_OAC.docx"
```

### Structured Data (Project Config)
```
config.meeting_log           → All meetings, indexed by meeting_id
config.action_item_log       → All action items, indexed by action_id
config.last_meeting_date     → Date of most recent meeting
```

## Workflow Summary

1. **Meeting recorded** via /meeting-notes command
2. **Carry-forward items** automatically surface from previous meeting
3. **Action items** created with ID, assignee, due date
4. **.docx minutes** generated with professional formatting
5. **Morning brief** surfaces overdue items daily
6. **Weekly report** summarizes meeting activity and action items
7. **Daily report** calls out items due today
8. **Status updates** during next meeting (carry-forward logic)
9. **Items closed** when completed, tracked in closed_meeting field

## Key Fields Explained

- **meeting_id (MTG-001)**: Sequential, auto-assigned, never reset. Provides unique identifier for all meetings across project lifecycle.
- **action_id (AI-0001)**: Sequential, auto-assigned, never reset. Provides unique identifier for all action items. Used for cross-referencing in RFIs, COs, etc.
- **status**: Tracks action item lifecycle. "open" = assigned but not started, "in_progress" = actively being worked, "closed" = completed, "deferred" = pushed to future date.
- **created_meeting / closed_meeting**: Tracks which meeting created/closed the item. Enables historical reporting.
- **carry_forward_items[]**: Explicit list of items carried from previous meeting. Differentiates carry-forward from newly created items.
- **linked_rfi / linked_co / linked_submittal**: Cross-references to related project documents. Enables quick navigation from meeting minutes to RFI/CO/submittal tracking.

## Trigger Phrases
The skill activates on phrases like:
- "Take meeting minutes"
- "Record meeting notes"
- "OAC meeting notes"
- "What are our open action items?"
- "Follow up on this action item"
- "Carry forward items from last meeting"
- "Generate meeting report"
- "Pre-install conference"
