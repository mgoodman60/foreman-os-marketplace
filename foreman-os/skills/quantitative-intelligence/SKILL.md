# Quantitative Intelligence

## Overview

A calculation bridge that connects all measurement sources to the project intelligence data store, with a complete cross-sheet reference index enabling multi-page calculations and spatial correlations.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Builds a Sheet Cross-Reference Index** — Maps every detail callout, section cut, schedule reference, and spec reference across the entire plan set so Claude knows how sheets connect
2. **Creates Assembly Chains** — Links related elements across multiple sheets (e.g., footing plan view → section detail → structural notes → concrete spec) into calculation chains
3. **Calculates Derived Quantities** — Computes volumes, areas, lengths, and counts by pulling dimensions from multiple sheets through assembly chains
4. **Merges Multiple Data Sources** — Combines DXF geometry (exact), visual analysis (approximate), takeoff measurements (calibrated), and text extraction (parsed) with clear priority rules
5. **Flags Discrepancies** — When sources disagree by >10%, flags for superintendent review
6. **Stores in Project Intelligence** — All quantities go into `plans-spatial.json` with source attribution for downstream use by reports, dashboards, and briefs

## Data Source Priority

When the same measurement exists from multiple sources, use the highest-priority source and note others as validation:

| Priority | Source | Accuracy | When Available |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| 1 (highest) | DXF geometry | Exact coordinates | .dxf files processed through Phase 6 parse_dxf.py |
| 2 | Visual analysis | ±5-10% | Plan sheet images processed through Phase 7 visual_plan_analyzer.py |
| 3 | Takeoff measurement | ±2-5% (calibrated) | Scale-calibrated measurements from construction-takeoff skill |
| 4 (lowest) | Text extraction | Varies | Values parsed from PDF text, notes, schedules |

**Discrepancy Rule**: When any two sources disagree by >10%, flag for review. The superintendent resolves discrepancies — Claude does not auto-resolve.

## Integration with construction-takeoff Cowork Skill

For plan-based quantity extraction, the `construction-takeoff` Cowork skill provides an alternative or complementary workflow. When a takeoff is performed using that skill, its calibrated measurements feed directly into the Data Source Priority system at Priority Level 3. If the construction-takeoff skill detects quantities that differ from DXF or visual analysis results by >10%, it triggers the discrepancy flag for superintendent review. This integration enables both tools to work together: quantitative-intelligence for cross-sheet assembly chains and derived calculations, and construction-takeoff for focused material-by-material measurement and cost rollups.

## Sheet Cross-Reference Index

### What Gets Indexed

The cross-reference index captures every connection between sheets in the plan set:

| Reference Type | Example | Data Captured |
|---------------|---------|---------------|
| **Detail callout** | Circle with "3/A5.2" on floor plan | Source sheet, target sheet, target detail number, location (grid), linked elements |
| **Section cut** | Heavy dashed line with "A/A4.1" marker | Source sheet, target sheet, cut direction, elements crossed |
| **Interior elevation** | Triangle with "1/A6.1" | Source sheet, target sheet, viewing direction, room referenced |
| **Enlarged plan** | Dashed rectangle with "A3.1" ref | Source sheet, target sheet, area enclosed, scale change |
| **Schedule reference** | Door mark "D101" on plan → door schedule on A8.1 | Plan sheet, schedule sheet, item mark, item count on each |
| **Spec callout** | "09 65 00" text on plan or note | Sheet, spec section, context, all sheets it applies to |
| **General notes** | "SEE STRUCTURAL GENERAL NOTES S1.0" | Source sheet, target sheet, scope of applicability |
| **Wall type** | Wall type tag "2A" → wall type schedule | Plan sheet, schedule/legend sheet, wall type, all occurrences |

### Building the Index

The index is built automatically during document processing:

1. **During text extraction** (Phase 5): Parse sheet references from OCR'd text (patterns like "A5.2", "DETAIL 3/A5.2", "SEE SHEET S1.0")
2. **During visual analysis** (Phase 7): Detect detail callout bubbles, section markers, elevation markers as symbols, read their text content
3. **During DXF extraction** (Phase 6): Extract block attributes that contain sheet references
4. **Cross-validate**: Compare the index against the drawing index (sheet list) to flag references to missing sheets

### Spec Section Cross-References

When new spec sections are added via `/process-docs`:

1. Scan the new spec sections for plan sheet references (e.g., "See Sheet S2.1 for footing layout")
2. Add these to `sheet_cross_references.spec_references` — linking spec section → plan sheet
3. Scan for CSI division callouts that reference work types already in the quantity database
4. If a new spec section provides a value (e.g., concrete strength) that's also extracted from plans, cross-verify and flag discrepancies

### Using the Index

When calculating quantities or answering questions about specific elements:

1. **Look up the element** in the cross-reference index
2. **Follow assembly chains** to gather all related data from connected sheets
3. **Aggregate** dimensions, specs, and details from all linked sheets
4. **Calculate** derived quantities using the complete picture

**Example — "How much concrete for Footing F1?"**

```
Assembly Chain CHAIN-001: Footing F1 at Grid C-3
├── S2.1 (Foundation Plan): Location at C-3, plan dimensions 4'-0" x 8'-0"
├── S5.1 (Structural Details): Detail 3 — section shows depth 2'-0", rebar #5@12" E.W.
├── S1.0 (Structural Notes): 4,000 PSI concrete, #5 bars Grade 60
└── Spec 03 30 00: w/c ratio 0.45, slump 4"±1", air 5.5%±1.5%

Calculation:
  Volume = 4.0' × 8.0' × 2.0' = 64 CF = 2.37 CY
  Add 10% waste: 2.61 CY
  Concrete: 4,000 PSI per S1.0 / Spec 03 30 00
  Rebar: #5@12" E.W. per S5.1 Detail 3
```

## Assembly Chains

An assembly chain links every piece of information about a single construction element across all sheets where it appears. Chains are the foundation for multi-page calculations.

### Chain Structure

Each chain has:
- **Element identifier** (e.g., "Footing F1", "Wall Type 2A", "RTU-1")
- **Links** — ordered list of sheets and what data each provides
- **Calculated values** — derived from combining all link data
- **Source priority** — which source provided each value

### Common Chain Types

| Chain Type | Typical Links | Calculates |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Footing** | Foundation plan → footing detail → structural notes → spec | Volume (CY), rebar weight (lbs), form area (SF) |
| **Wall** | Floor plan (length) → building section (height) → wall type legend (assembly) → spec | Total LF, total SF, GWB SF, insulation SF, stud count |
| **Room** | Floor plan (boundary) → finish schedule (materials) → RCP (ceiling) → spec | Area SF, perimeter LF, wall SF, ceiling SF, flooring SF |
| **SOG** | Floor plan (area) → structural notes (thickness) → spec (concrete) | Area SF, volume CY, vapor barrier SF, rebar/WWF qty |
| **Roof** | Roof plan (area) → building section (slope/assembly) → spec (roofing) | Area SF (flat), area SF (sloped), insulation SF |
| **PEMB column** | PEMB reaction drawing → foundation plan → anchor bolt layout → erection plan | Reaction loads, anchor bolt spec, tributary area |
| **Pipe run** | Plumbing plan sheet 1 + sheet 2 + ... → riser diagram → spec | Total LF by size, fitting count, hanger count |
| **Equipment** | MEP plan (location) → equipment schedule (specs) → spec (requirements) | Count, capacity, electrical requirements, clearances |

### Building Chains Automatically

1. Start from a **known element** (room number, footing mark, equipment tag)
2. Look up all **cross-references** in the index that mention this element
3. Follow each reference to its **target sheet**
4. Extract the **relevant data** from each linked sheet
5. Assemble the chain and **calculate derived quantities**

### Assembly Chain Impact from Non-Plan Documents

When `/process-docs` processes RFI responses, submittal approvals, or change orders that reference specific plan elements:

- The affected assembly chain should be marked with `needs_verification: true`
- The verification note should reference the source document: "RFI-003 response may affect Footing F1 assembly chain — rebar callout clarified"
- On the next plan processing run, chains marked `needs_verification` are rebuilt first
- This prevents quantity data from becoming stale when clarifications arrive via non-plan documents

---

## Calculation Capabilities

### Initial vs Incremental Quantity Processing

- **First run** (no existing quantities): Build the full quantity baseline. Extract all measurable elements, create all assembly chains, and establish source attribution for every value. Note in output: "Initial quantity baseline established — X elements tracked across Y sheets."
- **Incremental** (quantities already exist): Only recalculate quantities affected by newly processed sheets. Preserve existing chains and only rebuild where new data touches them. Cross-verify new values against existing ones.

### Concrete Volumes

From structural details — DXF polylines provide exact footing outlines; visual dimensions provide depth from structural notes.

| Element | Formula | Sources |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Footings | L × W × D per footing × count | Foundation plan + footing detail |
| SOG | Area × thickness | Floor plan + structural notes |
| Grade beams | L × W × D | Foundation plan + detail |
| Piers | π × r² × D or L × W × D | Foundation plan + detail |
| Walls | L × H × T | Floor plan + building section |
| Curbs | L × W × H | Site plan + detail |

Always add waste factor: 5% for formed elements, 10% for footings (over-excavation), 3% for SOG.

### Room Areas and Perimeters

From DXF closed polylines (exact) or visual measurements (approximate) or dimension annotations on plans.

- **Area**: Shoelace formula on polyline vertices (DXF), or pixel counting at calibrated scale (visual)
- **Perimeter**: Sum of polyline segment lengths (DXF), or boundary tracing (visual)
- **Wall area**: Perimeter × ceiling height (from building section or room elevation)
- **Ceiling area**: Same as floor area (flat ceiling) or calculated from section (sloped/vaulted)

### Material Quantities by CSI Division

Aggregate individual items into division totals:

- **Division 03**: Total CY of concrete by mix type, total tons of rebar by grade
- **Division 05**: Total tons of structural steel, total LF of miscellaneous metals
- **Division 07**: Total SF of roofing, insulation, waterproofing, sealant LF
- **Division 08**: Door count by type, hardware set count, window count by type
- **Division 09**: Flooring SF by type, GWB SF, ceiling SF by type, paint SF
- **Division 22**: Fixture count by type, pipe LF by size, valve count
- **Division 23**: Equipment count, ductwork LF/SF, diffuser count
- **Division 26**: Panel count, outlet count by type, switch count, light fixture count

### PEMB-Specific Quantities

- **Tributary areas** per column (bay spacing × frame spacing)
- **Bay areas** (length × width per bay)
- **Wall panel SF** (eave height × perimeter, minus openings)
- **Roof panel SF** (ridge length × slope length × 2 sides)
- **Gutter LF** (eave length, both sides)
- **Downspout count** (typically 1 per 40-50 LF of gutter)

### Flooring by Type

Total SF of each flooring material from finish schedule + room areas + visual zone detection:

1. Read finish schedule for room → flooring material mapping
2. Look up room area from quantities.rooms
3. Sum by material type
4. Cross-check against visual material zone detection (Phase 7)
5. Flag discrepancies >10%

### Symbol Counts

Total fixture/device counts from visual detection, validated against schedule counts:

1. Visual Pass 4 detects symbols on plan sheets
2. Aggregate counts across all plan sheets (avoid double-counting on overlapping sheets)
3. Compare against schedule counts (door schedule, fixture schedule, panel schedule)
4. Flag discrepancies — schedule count is authoritative; visual count validates

## Integration with Downstream Skills

### /morning-brief
When the morning brief mentions today's work areas, include relevant quantities:
- "Room 007 Therapy: 450 SF VCT flooring, 86 LF vinyl base"
- "Footings at Grid C-3 through D-5: 12.4 CY concrete (4,000 PSI), #5@12" E.W."
- "22 duplex outlets remaining in East Wing (63 of 85 installed = 74%)"

### /daily-report
When daily reports reference work completed, enable percentage calculations:
- "Completed VCT in Rooms 007-009: 1,240 SF of 4,800 SF total (26%)"
- "Poured Footings F1-F4: 9.5 CY of 42.3 CY total footings (22%)"
- "Installed 15 duplex outlets in Rooms 101-108 (East Wing: 63/85 = 74%)"

### /look-ahead
When generating lookahead schedules, include material quantities for upcoming activities:
- "Week 2: SOG pour Area B — 156 CY concrete needed, 4 trucks at 40 CY/day"
- "Week 3: VCT installation Rooms 201-215 — 3,200 SF, ~4 days at 800 SF/day"

### /project-dashboard
Quantity summary section showing:
- Total quantities by CSI division
- Percent complete by material type (installed / total)
- Discrepancy log with resolution status
- Source attribution breakdown (what % from DXF, visual, takeoff, text)

---

## Workflow

### Initial Quantity Extraction (during /set-project or /process-docs)

1. **Build drawing index** from sheet list (sheet numbers, titles, disciplines)
2. **Build cross-reference index** from text + visual + DXF extraction results
3. **Identify assembly chains** by tracing cross-references for key elements
4. **Calculate quantities** using assembly chains + data from all sources
5. **Flag discrepancies** where sources disagree >10%
6. **Store in config** under `plans-spatial.json` `quantities` and `sheet_cross_references`
7. **Report summary** to superintendent for validation

### Incremental Updates (when new documents added)

1. **Read existing index** from config
2. **Process new document** through extraction pipeline
3. **Update index** with new cross-references
4. **Recalculate affected chains** (only chains linked to new/changed sheets)
5. **Update quantities** and flag new discrepancies
6. **Report changes** to superintendent

### On-Demand Queries

When the superintendent asks a quantity question:

1. **Check stored quantities** in config
2. **If available**: Return with source attribution and confidence
3. **If not available**: Build assembly chain on-the-fly, calculate, store, return
4. **If discrepancy exists**: Present both values, ask for resolution

## Cross-Verification — Checking Your Work Across Sheets

The same data point often appears on multiple sheets. This is intentional — construction documents are redundant by design. Use this redundancy to **verify accuracy and build confidence** in extracted values.

### The Verification Principle

**Every critical measurement should be confirmed from at least two independent sources.** When two sources agree, confidence is HIGH. When they disagree, flag for review — one of them is wrong (or the drawings have a coordination error the super needs to know about).

### What to Cross-Check and Where

| Data Point | Primary Source | Verification Source(s) | How to Check |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Pipe length** | Plan view (measured centerline) | Profile view (station-to-station distances) | Plan LF should match profile station difference |
| **Pipe size** | Plan view (label on pipe) | Profile view (pipe schedule), Plumbing schedule | All three should match |
| **Pipe invert elevation** | Profile view (invert table) | Plan view (spot elevation at manholes) | Profile inverts should match plan spot elevations |
| **Footing size** | Foundation plan (dimensions) | Footing detail (cross-section dims) | Plan L×W should match detail L×W; detail adds depth |
| **Concrete strength** | Structural general notes | Spec Section 03 30 00 | Must match — if not, spec governs per most contracts |
| **Room area** | Floor plan (scaled or dimensioned) | Finish schedule (if area column exists) | Should match within 5% |
| **Door size** | Door schedule | Door detail (if exists) | Must match — schedule is authoritative |
| **Equipment capacity** | Equipment schedule | Equipment detail/spec sheet | Must match — schedule is design intent |
| **Building dimensions** | Floor plan outer dimension string | Site plan building footprint | Must match |
| **Finish floor elevation** | Architectural floor plan (FFE) | Civil grading plan (pad + slab thickness) | Pad elev + slab thickness should = FFE |
| **Ceiling height** | Room finish schedule | Building section (floor-to-ceiling dim) | Must match |
| **Grid spacing** | Foundation plan (dimension strings) | Framing plan (dimension strings) | Must match exactly — this is the structural skeleton |
| **Slab thickness** | Structural notes (typical thickness) | Building section (shown in section) | Must match |
| **Rebar size/spacing** | Structural detail (shown in section) | Structural notes (listed by element) | Must match |
| **Wall assembly** | Wall type legend/schedule | Building section (shown in section) | Layers and thickness must match |

### Grading Plan Cross-Verification

Grading plans are a special case because **existing and proposed grades are always on separate sheets** (or separate line types on the same sheet):

1. **Existing grade** — From survey/topo sheet (C-001 or C-100 series), shown as dashed contours
2. **Proposed grade** — From grading plan (C-200 series or same sheet), shown as solid contours
3. **Cut/fill calculation** requires overlaying BOTH — at every point, subtract existing from proposed
4. **Verify FFE** — The proposed grade at the building pad should be consistent with the FFE on architectural plans minus slab thickness minus subbase
5. **Verify drainage** — Proposed contours should show water flowing AWAY from the building (grade drops away from FFE in all directions)

**Verification formula:**
```
FFE (Arch) = Pad Elevation (Civil) + Subbase Thickness + Slab Thickness
```
If this doesn't check out, there's a coordination error between civil and architectural.

### Dimension String Verification

Dimension strings contain built-in cross-checks:

```
|←— 12'-0" —→|←— 30'-0" —→|←— 30'-0" —→|←— 12'-0" —→|
|←————————————————— 84'-0" ————————————————————————→|
```

**Check:** Do the individual dimensions sum to the overall dimension?
- 12 + 30 + 30 + 12 = 84 ✓

If they don't match, the drawings have an error. Flag it — this is exactly the kind of thing a superintendent needs to catch before construction.

### Confidence Scoring

After cross-verification, assign confidence based on how many sources agree:

| Sources Checked | Agreement | Confidence Level |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 3+ sources, all agree | Full agreement | **VERIFIED** — high confidence |
| 2 sources, agree | Agreement | **CONFIRMED** — good confidence |
| 2 sources, within 5% | Minor variance | **LIKELY CORRECT** — acceptable for estimation |
| 2 sources, 5-10% apart | Moderate variance | **CHECK** — may be rounding or scale measurement error |
| 2 sources, >10% apart | Major discrepancy | **DISCREPANCY** — flag for superintendent review |
| 1 source only | No verification | **UNVERIFIED** — use with caution, note in output |

## Spatial Clash Detection — Multi-Discipline Coordination

Construction documents are drawn by different disciplines (Architecture, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, Fire Protection) working on the same building. Each discipline draws their systems on **separate sheets but in the same physical space**. Conflicts happen when two systems try to occupy the same location.

### How 2D Clash Detection Works

Since we're working from 2D drawings (not 3D BIM), clash detection is done by **comparing elevation data across disciplines** at the same plan location:

1. **Identify shared spaces** — Areas where multiple disciplines have systems (above ceilings, in mechanical rooms, in walls, at floor penetrations)
2. **Extract elevation data** from each discipline at those locations
3. **Compare** — If two elements occupy the same horizontal location AND the same elevation range, there's a potential clash

### What to Compare

| Discipline A | Discipline B | Potential Clash | How to Check |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Mechanical ductwork** | **Structural beams** | Duct routing conflicts with beam depth | Compare duct bottom elevation vs beam bottom elevation at crossing points |
| **Plumbing waste pipe** | **Electrical conduit** | Both running at same elevation in ceiling | Compare pipe centerline elevation vs conduit elevation at crossings |
| **Plumbing waste pipe** | **Structural beam** | Pipe penetrating beam (not allowed without engineer approval) | Check if pipe elevation passes through beam depth at crossing |
| **HVAC diffuser** | **Light fixture** | Both trying to occupy same ceiling grid location | Compare RCP locations — diffusers and fixtures should not overlap |
| **Sprinkler main** | **Ductwork** | Fire protection main conflicts with duct routing | Compare elevations at crossing points |
| **Electrical panel** | **Door swing** | Panel blocked by door opening | Check door swing arc vs panel face clearance (36" clear required) |
| **Equipment clearance** | **Wall/column** | Maintenance access blocked | Check equipment service clearance envelope vs nearby obstructions |

### Elevation Data Sources by Discipline

To do clash detection, you need elevation data. Here's where to find it:

| Element | Where Elevation Is Shown |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Structural beams** | Structural framing plan (TOS = Top of Steel), building sections |
| **Ductwork** | Mechanical plan (duct sizes shown, bottom of duct noted or derivable from ceiling height minus duct depth) |
| **Piping** | Plumbing plan (inverts and pipe size give you the full profile), riser diagrams |
| **Conduit** | Electrical plan (usually follows ceiling space — elevation rarely noted explicitly, assume just below structure) |
| **Sprinkler mains** | Fire protection plan (elevation noted or derivable from ceiling type and required clearance) |
| **Ceiling plane** | RCP (ceiling height noted by room) |

### Clearance Rules

When systems cross, minimum clearances apply:

| Crossing | Minimum Clearance |
|----------|------------------|
| Duct below beam | 1" minimum (but consider insulation) |
| Pipe below beam | Pipe OD + hangers + 1" |
| Sprinkler below duct | 1-3" below duct bottom (per NFPA) |
| Anything above ceiling | Must fit between structure bottom and ceiling grid top (typically 12"-36" of plenum space) |
| Mechanical equipment | 36" service clearance on access side |
| Electrical panels | 36" clear in front (NEC), 30" wide |

### How to Report Clashes

When a potential clash is detected, report it with:

```
POTENTIAL CLASH: Plumbing vs Structural at Grid C-3
- 4" waste pipe at elevation 112'-6" (from P-101, heading east)
- W12x26 beam bottom at elevation 112'-4" (from S-201, running N-S)
- Conflict: Pipe centerline is 2" ABOVE beam bottom
- Impact: Pipe would penetrate beam web — requires structural engineer review
- Resolution options: (1) Reroute pipe below beam, (2) Core drill with sleeve (needs SE approval)
```

### Practical Coordination Sequence

When processing a full plan set:

1. **Extract structural framework first** — beam locations, sizes, bottom elevations (this is the "ceiling" that everything else must fit under)
2. **Extract mechanical ductwork** — main trunk lines, sizes, routing (these are the biggest elements in the ceiling space)
3. **Extract plumbing** — waste and supply lines, sizes, elevations where noted
4. **Extract fire protection** — mains and branch lines
5. **Extract electrical** — conduit runs (typically smallest, most flexible)
6. **Compare at every crossing point** — any location where two disciplines cross paths on the plan
7. **Check plenum depth** — at every point, verify that ALL systems fit between the structural bottom and the ceiling plane

## Estimate-to-Field Quantity Reconciliation

Connect extracted plan quantities to estimating knowledge so the superintendent can manage costs in the field, not just geometry. Every quantity extracted by the assembly chain system should be traceable to a cost code, comparable against the bid estimate, convertible to an order quantity, and usable for pay application verification.

### CSI Cost Code Mapping

Every extracted quantity maps to a CSI MasterFormat cost code. This enables budget tracking, pay application line items, and trade-specific scope analysis.

#### Cost Code Hierarchy

CSI codes follow a strict hierarchy that enables roll-up reporting:

```
Division (2 digits)     03          — Concrete (all concrete work)
  Section (4 digits)    03 30       — Cast-in-Place Concrete
    Subsection (6 dig)  03 30 00    — Cast-in-Place Concrete (general)
      Item              03 30 00.10 — Footing F1 at Grid C-3 (project-specific)
```

When mapping extracted quantities, assign at the 6-digit level minimum. Project-specific item codes (the .10, .20, etc.) are assigned by the project estimator and should be matched to the bid breakdown if available.

#### Auto-Classification Rules

When an assembly chain produces a quantity, classify it automatically:

1. **Concrete assemblies** — Any chain that calculates volume in CY from formed elements routes to 03 30 00. If rebar is included in the chain, split: concrete volume to 03 30 00, rebar weight to 03 20 00, formwork area to 03 10 00.
2. **Masonry assemblies** — Any chain involving CMU block counts or masonry wall SF routes to 04 22 00. Reinforcing grout in CMU stays in 04 22 00 (not 03 30 00).
3. **Room finish assemblies** — Parse the finish schedule material column: VCT to 09 65 16, carpet to 09 68 13, ceramic tile to 09 30 00, paint to 09 91 00, ACT ceiling to 09 51 00.
4. **MEP assemblies** — Classify by system: pipe runs by pipe type (domestic water vs. sanitary vs. storm), ductwork to 23 31 13, electrical devices by type to appropriate 26 XX XX code.

### Plan-to-Estimate Quantity Comparison

The most valuable use of extracted quantities is comparing them against the bid estimate to catch scope changes before they become cost problems.

#### Reconciliation Workflow

```
Step 1: Extract plan quantity (from assembly chain)
Step 2: Look up bid quantity (from estimate, if available in project docs)
Step 3: Calculate delta = (plan qty - bid qty) / bid qty × 100%
Step 4: Classify impact using tolerance thresholds
Step 5: Recommend action based on classification
```

#### Tolerance Thresholds and Actions

| Delta Range | Classification | Action | Who Needs to Know |
|------------|---------------|--------|-------------------|
| ≤ 5% | **Within Estimate** | No action — normal measurement variance | Log only |
| 5% – 10% | **Monitor** | Note in quantity log, review at next OAC meeting | Superintendent + PM |
| 10% – 20% | **Investigate** | Compare plan revision dates, check for ASIs or addenda that explain the change | PM + estimator |
| > 20% | **Flag for Re-Pricing** | Likely scope change — initiate change order process | PM + estimator + owner |
| Negative (plan < bid) | **Potential Credit** | Verify reduction is real, not a measurement error; if confirmed, may need to issue credit CO | PM + estimator |

#### Trade-Level Scope Tracking

Roll up plan-vs-estimate deltas by CSI division to see which trades are growing or shrinking:

```
Division 03 — Concrete:     Plan 485 CY vs Bid 460 CY = +5.4% [MONITOR]
Division 04 — Masonry:      Plan 8,200 SF vs Bid 8,400 SF = -2.4% [WITHIN]
Division 09 — Finishes:     Plan 22,800 SF vs Bid 19,500 SF = +16.9% [INVESTIGATE]
Division 22 — Plumbing:     Plan 62 fixtures vs Bid 58 fixtures = +6.9% [MONITOR]
Division 26 — Electrical:   Plan 285 devices vs Bid 240 devices = +18.8% [INVESTIGATE]
```

When multiple divisions trend upward simultaneously, this often indicates an addendum or revision that added scope. Check the revision block on the plans against the bid set revision date.

### Material Procurement Quantities

Extracted quantities tell you how much material goes into the building. Order quantities account for waste, packaging, and practical field considerations.

#### Order Quantity Formula

```
Order Quantity = (Extracted Plan Quantity × Waste Factor) rounded up to packaging unit
```

#### Standard Waste Factors by Material

| Material | Waste Factor | Reason | Packaging Round-Up |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Concrete (formed) | +5–7% | Over-vibration, spillage, pump line cleanup | Nearest 0.5 CY (truck increment) |
| Concrete (SOG/flatwork) | +3–5% | Grade variance, bulkheads | Nearest 0.5 CY |
| Rebar | +3–5% | Lap splices, cut waste, bent bar waste | Nearest bundle (varies by bar size) |
| CMU block | +3–5% | Cutting, breakage, corners | Nearest cube (90 for 8" standard) |
| Lumber (framing) | +7–10% | Crown cull, cutting waste, damaged pieces | Nearest unit (per piece) |
| Plywood/OSB sheathing | +5–8% | Cutting waste at edges and openings | Nearest sheet (4x8) |
| Gypsum wallboard | +10–12% | Cutouts for openings, damaged sheets, butt joints | Nearest sheet (4x8 or 4x12) |
| Paint | +10–15% | Touch-up, multiple coats, surface texture variation | Nearest gallon or 5-gallon bucket |
| Roofing membrane | +5–8% | Side laps, end laps, edge trim waste | Nearest roll |
| Ceramic/porcelain tile | +10–15% | Cuts at walls, pattern waste, breakage | Nearest box (varies by tile size) |
| Carpet tile | +5–8% | Pattern matching, cuts at walls, attic stock | Nearest carton (typically 48 SF) |
| VCT | +5–8% | Cuts at walls, pattern alignment, breakage | Nearest carton (typically 45 SF) |
| ACT ceiling tile | +5–8% | Border cuts, damaged tiles, attic stock | Nearest carton (varies) |
| Insulation (batt) | +3–5% | Compression at framing, cutting waste | Nearest bag/roll |
| Insulation (rigid board) | +5–8% | Cutting waste at corners and penetrations | Nearest sheet (4x8) |
| Ductwork | +5–8% | Fittings waste, field adjustments | Nearest LF or EA |
| Piping (copper/PVC) | +5–8% | Fittings allowance, cut waste | Nearest 10 LF or 20 LF stick |
| Conduit | +5–8% | Bends, cut waste | Nearest 10 LF stick |
| Wire/cable | +10–12% | Homeruns, slack loops, termination waste | Nearest 250 LF or 1000 LF spool |

#### Procurement Example

```
Assembly Chain: SOG Area B
  Extracted plan area: 4,800 SF
  Slab thickness: 6" (from structural notes)
  Concrete volume: 4,800 × 0.5 / 27 = 88.9 CY
  Waste factor: +5% → 88.9 × 1.05 = 93.3 CY
  Truck round-up: 94 CY (nearest 0.5 CY = 94.0)
  Truck count at 10 CY/truck: 10 trucks (9.4 → round up)

  WWF 6×6-W1.4×W1.4: 4,800 SF + 10% lap allowance = 5,280 SF
  Roll round-up: 5,280 / 750 SF per roll = 7.04 → 8 rolls

  Vapor barrier (10 mil): 4,800 SF + 10% lap = 5,280 SF
  Roll round-up: 5,280 / 600 SF per roll = 8.8 → 9 rolls
```

#### Lead Time Awareness

When extracted quantities are large or involve specialty items, flag lead time concerns:

| Material | Typical Lead Time | Flag Threshold |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Ready-mix concrete | 24–48 hours (standard mixes) | >100 CY single pour (need pump + staging plan) |
| Structural steel | 8–12 weeks (fabrication) | All structural steel (always long lead) |
| Rebar (fabricated) | 2–4 weeks | >5 TON total or custom bent shapes |
| Hollow metal frames | 4–6 weeks | >20 frames or custom sizes |
| Aluminum storefront | 8–12 weeks | All storefront/curtain wall |
| Rooftop HVAC units | 10–16 weeks | All RTUs/AHUs |
| Electrical switchgear | 12–20 weeks | Main distribution and large panels |
| Elevator | 16–24 weeks | All elevators |
| Fire sprinkler fabrication | 4–6 weeks | All sprinkler systems (after approved drawings) |
| Specialty tile/stone | 6–12 weeks | Imported or custom materials |

**Decision rule**: If extracted quantity triggers a flag threshold AND the schedule shows that trade starting within 2× the lead time window, issue a procurement alert to the superintendent.

### Pay Application Verification

Use extracted quantities as an independent check on monthly pay applications. The superintendent's job is to verify that the percent complete claimed on a pay application reflects reality in the field.

#### Quantity-in-Place Method

The most reliable way to verify progress is to measure what is actually installed and compare it to the total extracted quantity:

```
% Complete = Installed Quantity / Total Extracted Quantity × 100

Example — Concrete Foundations:
  Total extracted: 42.3 CY (from assembly chains, all footings + grade beams)
  Installed to date: Footings F1–F4 poured = 9.5 CY (measured from pour tickets)
  % Complete = 9.5 / 42.3 = 22.5%

  Contractor claimed: 25% → Delta = 2.5% → ACCEPTABLE (within 5% tolerance)
```

#### Unit Price Verification

Compare the unit price on the schedule of values against the contract unit price:

| Check | Formula | Flag If |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Unit price match | SOV unit price vs. contract unit price | Difference > $0.01 |
| Line item math | Claimed qty × unit price = claimed amount | Does not equal |
| Total check | Sum of line items = total contract amount | Does not equal |
| Retainage | Earned amount × retainage % = retainage withheld | Does not equal |

#### Earned Value Calculation

```
Earned Value = Installed Quantity × Contract Unit Price

Example — CMU Masonry:
  Contract: 8,400 SF CMU × $18.50/SF = $155,400 (schedule of values line item)
  Installed this period: 1,200 SF
  Installed to date: 4,800 SF
  Earned this period: 1,200 × $18.50 = $22,200
  Earned to date: 4,800 × $18.50 = $88,800
  % Complete: 4,800 / 8,400 = 57.1%
```

#### Unusual Progress Flags

Flag pay application line items that show suspicious progress jumps:

| Condition | Flag Level | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Single period jump > 15% on items > $50,000 | **WARNING** | Verify with field observation — was that much work actually done? |
| Item goes from < 20% to > 80% in one period | **ALERT** | Almost certainly incorrect — request backup documentation |
| Item at 100% but work visibly incomplete | **REJECT** | Do not approve — require revised pay app |
| Item decreasing (negative progress) | **INVESTIGATE** | May indicate prior over-billing being corrected |
| Multiple items all at same round % (e.g., all 50%) | **SUSPICIOUS** | Suggests contractor estimated rather than measured |
| Stored material claimed > 30% of line item | **VERIFY** | Confirm material is on-site, properly stored, and matches specs |

---

## Assembly Chain Cost Awareness

Extend the assembly chain system with cost intelligence so the superintendent can understand the dollar impact of every quantity, flag high-value assemblies for enhanced QC, calculate change order impacts quickly, and track budget performance at the assembly level.

### Unit Cost Attachment

For each assembly chain, attach approximate unit cost ranges to transform quantities into cost estimates. Use ranges rather than point estimates because material and labor costs are market-dependent and vary by region, season, and project conditions.

#### Structural Assembly Cost Example

```
Assembly Chain CHAIN-001: Footing F1 at Grid C-3
├── Concrete: 2.37 CY × $180–220/CY    = $427–$521 (material only)
├── Rebar: 0.18 TON × $1,400–1,800/TON  = $252–$324 (material + placement)
├── Formwork: 56 SFCA × $8–12/SFCA      = $448–$672 (form + strip)
├── Excavation: 3.2 CY × $15–25/CY      = $48–$80
└── Backfill: 1.8 CY × $12–20/CY        = $22–$36
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Total Assembly Cost (material):         $1,197–$1,633
    Labor factor (typically 1.0–1.5× material for concrete): +$1,197–$2,450
    Estimated Installed Cost:               $2,394–$4,083
```

#### Architectural Finish Assembly Cost Example

```
Assembly Chain CHAIN-047: Room 201 — Office (320 SF)

├── HM Door/Frame: 1 EA × $800–1,200/EA       = $800–$1,200
└── Hardware Set: 1 EA × $350–600/EA           = $350–$600
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Estimated Installed Cost (this room):       $7,422–$11,460
```

#### Unit Cost Reference Ranges

These ranges represent typical installed costs (material + labor) for common assemblies. Actual costs depend on project location, market conditions, complexity, and access:

| Assembly Type | Unit | Low Range | Mid Range | High Range | Notes |
|--------------|------|-----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| CIP concrete (foundations) | CY | $350 | $500 | $750 | Includes form, place, finish, strip |
| CIP concrete (SOG) | SF | $6 | $9 | $14 | Includes prep, place, finish |
| CIP concrete (walls) | SF | $25 | $35 | $50 | Includes form both sides, place, strip |
| Rebar (placed) | TON | $1,800 | $2,400 | $3,200 | Includes cut, bend, place, tie |
| CMU wall (grouted + reinforced) | SF | $14 | $20 | $28 | Includes block, grout, rebar, labor |

| Sprinkler head (pendant) | EA | $80 | $130 | $200 | Installed with drop and head |

### High-Cost Assembly Flagging

Not all assemblies warrant the same level of QC attention. Flag assemblies that represent significant cost or risk so the superintendent can allocate inspection time where it matters most.

#### Cost-Based Flags

| Condition | Flag Type | Superintendent Action |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| Assembly installed cost > $10,000 | **HIGH-VALUE** | Enhanced inspection: verify dimensions before pour/cover, witness critical operations |
| Assembly installed cost > $50,000 | **CRITICAL-VALUE** | Pre-work meeting with trade foreman, inspect at each phase, photo documentation |
| Assembly installed cost > $100,000 | **MAJOR-VALUE** | Dedicated QC plan, third-party inspection consideration, daily progress tracking |

#### Specialty Material Flags (Automatic, Regardless of Cost)

These materials get flagged automatically because they have high rework costs, are difficult to repair, or require specialized skills:

| Material/Assembly | Flag Reason | Extra QC Steps |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Architectural concrete (exposed) | Cannot repair cosmetically — must be right the first time | Review form liner, verify release agent, witness pour, inspect immediately at strip |
| Curtain wall / aluminum storefront | Long lead replacement, precision fit required | Check opening dimensions before order, inspect anchors before install |
| Terrazzo flooring | Expensive material, skilled labor, cannot easily patch | Verify substrate flatness, witness pour/grind, protect during other work |
| Epoxy flooring | Surface prep critical, fails if moisture present | Verify moisture test results, check substrate prep, temperature during install |
| Waterproofing (below grade) | Buried and inaccessible after backfill | Inspect every joint, flood test before backfill, photo document |
| Structural steel connections | Structural integrity, cannot easily re-do | Verify bolt torque or weld inspection, check plumbness |
| Fire-rated assemblies | Life safety, code compliance, inspection required | Verify UL assembly matches drawings, inspect penetration seals, document |
| Medical gas piping | Life safety, specialized testing required | Witness pressure test, verify brazer certification |

#### Critical Path + Cost Combined Flag

When an assembly is both high-cost AND on the critical path, it gets a combined flag:

```
⚠ CRITICAL PATH + HIGH VALUE: SOG Pour Area B
  Cost: ~$85,000 (156 CY concrete + WWF + VB + finishing)
  Schedule: 3-day activity on critical path, Day 45–47
  Delay impact: Every day of delay = 1 day to project completion
  Action: Pre-pour meeting required, pump truck confirmed, concrete plant notified,
          finishing crew sized for full area, weather window confirmed 72 hours out
```

### Change Impact Calculation

When a plan revision changes a dimension, spec, or quantity, trace through the assembly chain to estimate cost impact. This gives the superintendent immediate ammunition for change order discussions.

#### Dimension Change Impact

When a physical dimension changes, the cost impact ripples through the assembly:

```
CHANGE: Footing F1 depth increased from 2'-0" to 2'-6" (per ASI-004)

Assembly Chain CHAIN-001: Footing F1 at Grid C-3
  Original: 4.0' × 8.0' × 2.0' = 64 CF = 2.37 CY
  Revised:  4.0' × 8.0' × 2.5' = 80 CF = 2.96 CY
  Delta:    +0.59 CY concrete

  Cost Impact Breakdown:
  ├── Concrete: +0.59 CY × $200/CY (mid-range)   = +$118
  ├── Rebar: additional bottom mat area = same, but +2 vertical bars
  │   +0.04 TON × $2,400/TON                       = +$96
  ├── Formwork: +6" depth × 24 LF perimeter = +12 SFCA
  │   +12 SFCA × $10/SFCA                          = +$120
  ├── Excavation: +0.59 CY × $20/CY                = +$12
  └── Backfill: net change minimal                  = $0
      ──────────────────────────────────────────────
      Estimated Change Impact (this footing):        +$346

  If "TYP" for 6 similar footings:                  +$2,076
```

#### Specification Change Impact

When a material spec changes without a dimension change:

```
CHANGE: Concrete strength increased from 3,000 PSI to 4,000 PSI (per RFI-007)

  Affected assemblies: All SOG pours (Areas A, B, C)
  Total quantity: 312 CY (unchanged)

  Cost Impact:
  ├── 3,000 PSI concrete: ~$135/CY (material delivered)
  ├── 4,000 PSI concrete: ~$145/CY (material delivered)
  ├── Unit price delta: +$10/CY
  └── Total impact: 312 CY × $10/CY = +$3,120

  Additional considerations:
  ├── Testing frequency may increase (higher strength = more cylinders)
  │   Estimated: +8 sets × $45/set = +$360
  └── Curing requirements may be stricter (longer wet cure)
      Estimated: +$500 (additional labor for curing compound/blankets)
      ──────────────────────────────────────────────
      Total Estimated Change Impact:                 +$3,980
```

                               CHANGE ORDER TOTAL:      $6,819.56
```

#### Additive vs. Credit Calculations

Changes can increase or decrease scope. Track both:

| Change Type | Calculation | Format |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Additive** (more work) | New qty − original qty = added qty × unit price = ADD | Positive dollar amount |
| **Credit** (less work) | Original qty − new qty = deleted qty × unit price = CREDIT | Negative dollar amount (shown in parentheses) |
| **Substitution** (different spec) | (New unit price − old unit price) × quantity = NET | Can be add or credit |
| **Net change** | Sum of all adds and credits per CSI code = NET IMPACT | Show both gross and net |

### Budget Tracking Integration

Connect assembly-level cost awareness to overall project budget tracking so the superintendent has early warning when costs diverge from the estimate.

#### Assembly Cost to Budget Line Item Flow

```
Assembly Chain (CHAIN-001)
  └── Calculated cost: $2,394–$4,083
       └── CSI Code: 03 30 00 (concrete) + 03 20 00 (rebar) + 03 10 00 (formwork)
            └── Budget line items: 03 30 00 = $186,000 (total concrete budget)
                 └── Forecast: Budget ± approved COs ± pending COs = projected final cost
```

#### Budget Performance Tracking by Assembly Type

Track actual unit costs against estimated unit costs as work is completed:

| Assembly Type | Estimated Unit Cost | Actual Unit Cost | Variance | Status |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------|--------|
| Footings (CIP concrete) | $480/CY installed | $510/CY installed | +6.3% | MONITOR |
| SOG (6" w/ WWF) | $8.50/SF | $8.20/SF | -3.5% | WITHIN |
| CMU walls (grouted) | $19.00/SF | $22.50/SF | +18.4% | INVESTIGATE |
| GWB partitions | $12.00/SF | $11.75/SF | -2.1% | WITHIN |
| ACT ceilings | $5.50/SF | $5.50/SF | 0% | WITHIN |
| VCT flooring | $4.25/SF | — | — | NOT STARTED |

#### Early Warning Triggers

| Condition | Alert Level | Action |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Actual unit cost exceeds estimate by > 10% | **WARNING** | Investigate cause — was it a one-time issue or a trend? Review remaining work for same assembly type |
| Actual unit cost exceeds estimate by > 20% | **ESCALATE** | Notify PM immediately — may need budget revision or value engineering for remaining work |
| 3+ consecutive assemblies of same type over estimate | **TREND** | Systemic issue — the estimate may have been too low for this trade, or site conditions are driving up costs |
| Total committed + forecast exceeds budget by > 5% | **BUDGET ALERT** | Comprehensive review needed — identify offsets or request contingency release |
| Change orders consuming contingency > 50% with < 50% complete | **CONTINGENCY ALERT** | Project is trending over budget — escalate to owner and explore cost-saving measures |

#### Forecast Update Workflow

When new actual cost data comes in (from pay applications, purchase orders, or field reports):

```
Step 1: Record actual cost for completed assembly
Step 2: Calculate actual unit cost = total cost / quantity installed
Step 3: Compare to estimated unit cost → flag if > 10% variance
Step 4: Update forecast for remaining assemblies of same type:
        Remaining cost = remaining qty × actual unit cost (if trend) or estimated (if one-time issue)
Step 5: Roll up to division level → update project forecast
Step 6: Compare forecast to budget + approved COs → report variance
```
