## 1. Foundation Waterproofing

### Dampproofing vs. Waterproofing (Know the Difference)
- **Dampproofing**: Resists moisture vapor and liquid water contact. Bituminous coating applied to foundation exterior. Adequate for above-grade, low-water-table locations.
- **Waterproofing**: Resists hydrostatic pressure. Full membrane system required. Required for below-grade habitable spaces, high water table sites, clay soils with poor drainage.

### When Waterproofing is Required
- Below-grade spaces with occupancy (apartments, offices, storage rooms)
- Water table within 6 feet of lowest floor elevation
- Clay or silt soils with poor permeability
- Previous moisture problems or site history of flooding
- Check local code and soil boring report

### Spray-Applied Membranes (Most Common Field Choice)
- **System**: Polyurethane or polyurea, seamless application
- **Common products**: Rub-R-Wall, Mar-flex, Carlisle, Bituthene SPF
- **Application rate**: Typically 40-60 mils thick (confirm with manufacturer)
- **Field advantage**: Fast application (500-1000 SF/day), seamless, handles complex geometry
- **Substrate prep**: Surface must be clean, dry, no loose material. No water stains or damp concrete.
- **Temperature requirement**: Apply between 35-85°F (confirm per product — some have tighter windows)
- **Curing time**: Typically 24-48 hours before drainage board installation

### Sheet Membranes (Best for Detail Areas)
- **Peel-and-stick systems**: Bituthene, Preprufe, Henry BlueShield
- **Thickness**: Typically 40-80 mils depending on product
- **Field advantage**: Excellent for footings, penetrations, transitions. Allows controlled lap placement. Easy inspection of coverage.
- **Application**: Roll out, pull backing, press firmly. Overlay edges minimum 2 inches.
- **Temperature**: Lower application temperatures acceptable (some to 10°F with protection)
- **Common use**: Footing drains, wall-to-footing transitions, pipe penetrations

### Drainage Board (Always Over Waterproofing)
- **Purpose**: Protects membrane during backfill, provides drainage path
- **Material**: Plastic dimple board or rigid foam
- **Placement**: Against membrane, dimples face outward (toward soil)
- **Fastening**: Self-sticking or adhesive, light mechanical fastening acceptable
- **Overlap**: Minimum 2 inches minimum at all seams
- **Extend**: From base of footing to top of wall or grade level

### Protection Board (Over Drainage Board)
- **Purpose**: Prevents soil particles from clogging dimples
- **Material**: Rigid insulation board (XPS foam) or geotextile mat
- **Placement**: Over drainage board, lighter material toward soil
- **Thickness**: Typically 1-2 inches (varies by product)
- **Fasten**: Light adhesive or weight-held in place

### Backfill Practices
- **No large rocks or debris** against membrane, drainage board, or protection board
- **Granular backfill preferred**: Clean sand or gravel mix (5-20mm stone acceptable)
- **Granular next to board**: Larger rocks acceptable only after protection board layer
- **Lifts**: Compact in 12-inch lifts with light equipment (avoid heavy compaction immediately against board)
- **Timeline**: Don't backfill until waterproofing cure time elapsed and inspection complete

### Waterproofing Inspection Checklist
- **Before drainage board**: Foundation surface clean, membrane adhered fully (no bubbles), all seams sealed
- **Penetrations**: All sleeves, pipes, conduits sealed with compatible sealant or wrap
- **Laps and transitions**: All lap seams pressed firmly, minimum 2 inches confirmed
- **Terminations**: Membrane extends minimum 12 inches up wall, terminated per detail
- **Photo documentation**: Document all penetrations, corners, footing drains, material transitions before drainage board installation
- **Defects**: No tears, punctures, loose areas. Mark any repairs for follow-up after curing.

## 2. Roofing Systems Comparison

### TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin)
**Best for: Flat roofs, energy-efficient projects, standard commercial buildings**

| Characteristic | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Material** | Flexible white or tan thermoplastic sheet |
| **Thickness** | 45, 60, or 80 mil (60 mil most common) |
| **Reflectivity** | High (white finish), ENERGY STAR qualified |
| **Seams** | Heat-welded (most reliable), approximately 6+ MPa tensile strength |
| **Attachment** | Mechanically fastened (standard) or fully adhered |
| **Warranty** | 15-30 years depending on system |
| **Cost** | Mid-range |
| **Weakness** | Exposed fasteners can degrade over time |

**Field notes**: Heat-welded seams are superior to adhesive. Mechanical fasteners create penetrations (use sealant caps). Full adhesion eliminates penetrations but slower/more costly.

---

### EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer)
**Best for: Budget-conscious projects, large flat roofs, proven track record**

| Characteristic | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Material** | Rubber membrane, black or white |
| **Thickness** | 45 or 60 mil (45 mil common for cost) |
| **Seams** | Adhesive (lap cement) or tape seams |
| **Attachment** | Ballasted (stone weights), mechanically fastened, or fully adhered |
| **Warranty** | 15-25 years |
| **Cost** | Lower cost |
| **Weakness** | Seam adhesive degrades over 15-20 years vs. heat-welded alternatives |

**Field notes**: Adhesive seams require 48-72 hour cure time. Ballasted system simplest to install but allows membrane movement. No penetrations through ballasted systems.

### Built-Up Roofing (BUR)
**Best for: Heavy foot traffic areas, time-tested redundancy, traditional specifications**

| Characteristic | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Construction** | Alternating layers of bitumen and reinforcing fabric |
| **Ply count** | 3-ply, 4-ply, or 5-ply standard |
| **Surface** | Gravel top coat, mineral cap sheet, or reflective coating |
| **Warranty** | 15-25 years |
| **Cost** | Mid to higher cost |
| **Durability** | Proven 30+ year life in dry climates |
| **Maintenance** | Requires periodic gravel sweep and inspection |

**Field notes**: Heavy system (see structural capacity). Multiple plies = redundancy if one fails. Labor-intensive application, weather-dependent.

---

### Standing Seam Metal Roofing
**Best for: Sloped roofs, Pre-Engineered Buildings (PEMB), long service life, aesthetic projects**

| Characteristic | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Material** | Steel (galvanized or painted) or aluminum |
| **Gauge** | 24 or 26 gauge typical |
| **Seam type** | Concealed fastener, standing seam height 1.5" or 2" |
| **Minimum slope** | 1/4:12 (some manufacturers 1/2:12) |
| **Warranty** | 20-40 years (paint finish warranty separate) |
| **Cost** | Higher upfront |
| **Thermal movement** | Accommodate with floating clips; do not fully restrain |

**Field notes**: Fasteners hidden in seams = lower leak potential. Panels expand/contract with temperature (use floating fasteners). Requires continuous purlins or substrate.

## 3. Flashing Rules (Critical for Roof Longevity)

**CRITICAL: Flashing failures are the #1 cause of roof leaks. Every transition, penetration, and termination must be inspected and documented.**

### Base Flashing (Roof-to-Wall Transition)
- **Height above roof**: Minimum 8 inches
- **Material**: Flexible flashing (aluminum, lead, or compatible to roofing membrane)
- **Fastening**: Fastened to wall, NOT to roof
- **Overlap with roof**: Minimum 4 inches onto roof surface
- **End laps**: Minimum 6 inches, "shingled" (upper laps over lower)

### Counter-Flashing (Wall-Mounted Protection)
- **Reglet**: Cut into masonry 1.5 inches minimum depth, or receiver in wall
- **Vertical height**: Minimum 4 inches above base flashing
- **Lap over base flashing**: Minimum 4 inches
- **Fastening**: Fastened to wall, allows base flashing to expand
- **Sealant**: Top of counter-flashing sealed with compatible sealant

### End Laps (All Flashing Material)
- **Minimum overlap**: 6 inches
- **Direction**: Upper lap positioned to shed water (shingle style — upper over lower)

### Drip Edge (Fascia Detail)
- **Extension**: Minimum 3/4 inch past fascia, into gutter
- **Hangs**: Vertically down front of fascia
- **Fastening**: Fastened to roof edge, not to fascia only
- **Material**: Matches roof material or continuous metal

### Sealant Application (Flashing Transitions)
- **Use**: Where flashing meets dissimilar material (metal-to-masonry, metal-to-wood, etc.)
- **Sealant type**: Compatible to both materials (check TDS)
- **Width**: Minimum 1/4 inch, maximum 1/2 inch
- **Depth**: Minimum 1/4 inch (use backer rod for wider joints)
- **Cure time**: Allow full cure (typically 24-48 hours) before exposure

### Penetration Flashing (Pipes, Conduit, Vents)
- **Base flashing**: Around penetration, minimum 4 inches in all directions
- **Boot/collar**: Manufacturer boot (typical) or field fabricated metal boot
- **Sealant**: Sealed where boot meets pipe and where flashing meets roof
- **Pitch pans**: NOT acceptable for new construction (settling causes leaks) — use proper boot flashing

## 4. Window and Door Rough Openings

### Framing Tolerances by Construction Type

#### Wood Stud Construction
- **RO Width** = Frame width + 1/2 inch
- **RO Height** = Frame height + 1/2 inch
- **Reason**: 1/4" shim space on each side, 1/4" top space

#### Metal Stud Construction
- **RO Width** = Frame width + 1 inch
- **RO Height** = Frame height + 3/4 inch
- **Reason**: Wider tolerances for metal track, 1/2" shim space typical

#### Masonry Openings (Brick, Concrete Block)
- **RO Width** = Frame width + 1/2 to 3/4 inch
- **RO Height** = Frame height + 1/2 to 3/4 inch
- **NOTE**: Less tolerance than wood. Verify with window manufacturer and mason.

### Opening Geometry Tolerances
- **Level check**: Within 1/8 inch across opening (not cumulative)
- **Plumb check**: Within 1/8 inch per foot of height (max 3/8" for typical story height)
- **Square check**: Diagonal measurements within 1/8 inch of each other
- **Example**: For 4' × 6' opening, both diagonals should measure within 1/8" of each other

### Waterproofing (CRITICAL for Longevity)
- **Sill pan flashing**: Required at all window/door openings
- **Pan material**: Lead-lined membrane, flexible flashing, or compatible to wall system
- **Slope**: Minimum 5-10 degrees outward for positive drainage
- **Jamb flashing**: Turned-up flanges minimum 6 inches on wall face
- **Sealing**: Sealed at masonry transition, around frame perimeter
- **End dams**: Pan flashing turned up at ends to prevent side drainage

### Frame Installation
- **Shim placement**: Shims under frame at load-bearing points (typically header, sill, mid-height on mullions)
- **Sealant depth**: Backer rod in joint, sealant minimum 1/4 inch width
- **Fastening**: Per manufacturer specification (frame flange fasteners typical, 16" OC)
- **No fasteners in flashing**: All fasteners in frame, not in sill pan

### Air/Water Barrier Continuity
- **Barrier extends**: Behind frame perimeter, sealed to window frame
- **Lap sequence**: Exterior barrier lapped to shed water outboard
- **Sealant**: Compatible sealant at all barrier transitions

## 5. Air and Vapor Barrier Systems

### System Purpose
- **Air barrier**: Prevents air infiltration/exfiltration (reduces heating/cooling loss, pressure differences)
- **Vapor barrier**: Limits moisture vapor migration (prevents condensation and mold in wall assembly)
- **Combined systems**: Many modern barriers serve both functions

### Barrier Material Selection

| Material Type | Substrate | Permeance | Typical Application |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Self-adhered membrane** | Sheathing | Low (0.1-1 perm) | Exterior of insulation (cold climates) |
| **Fluid-applied** | Drywall, concrete | Low to medium | Interior face (warm side) |
| **Spray foam** | Cavity | Low (closed-cell) | Interior, combines barrier + insulation |
| **Polyethylene sheet** | Interior | Very low | Traditional interior barrier |

**Common products**: Blueskin, VaproShield, Prosoco, Henry, Dow Weathermate

### Location: Warm Side of Insulation
- **Cold climate** (Minnesota, New York, Canada): Vapor barrier on interior (warm side in winter)
- **Hot/humid climate** (Florida, Texas, Louisiana): Vapor barrier on exterior (warm side in summer, where dew point sits)
- **Mixed climate**: Consult design professional; typically interior location acceptable if low permeance exterior sheathing used
- **CRITICAL**: Wrong location = condensation in wall cavity = mold, rot, insulation failure

### Continuity is Non-Negotiable
- **Entire envelope**: Air barrier must be continuous across walls, roof, and foundation
- **Breaks in barrier**: Each penetration/junction is a failure point

#### Common Break Points (Inspection Focus)
- Wall-to-roof transition (parapet, hip, rake detail)
- Wall-to-foundation transition
- Window and door openings
- Electrical outlets, switches, penetrations
- HVAC ductwork transitions
- Plumbing runs through exterior walls

### Lapping Requirements
- **Standard lap**: Minimum 2 inches at all seams
- **Material transitions**: Minimum 6 inches lap (e.g., where two different products meet)
- **Fastener spacing**: Fasteners or adhesive per product (typical 16" OC)
- **Lapping direction**: Exterior barriers lap outboard (upper over lower), interior barriers lap inboard

### Penetration Sealing
- **All penetrations**: Pipes, conduits, vents, exhaust ducts
- **Seal method**: Sealant wrapping, compatible foam, or flange with sealant
- **Continuity restored**: Barrier must resume on other side of penetration

### Air Barrier Testing
- **Blower door test**: ASTM E779 or ASTM E1827
- **Commercial standard**: Maximum 0.25 CFM/SF at 75 Pa (5 Pa/CFM for low-rise residential per IECC)
- **Timing**: Performed after air barrier installation, before cladding (if testing barrier alone)
- **Result documentation**: Pressure vs. flow rate curve, identification of major leakage points

### Field Inspection Checklist
- **Before cladding/finishes**: Verify all laps sealed, penetrations sealed, no visible gaps
- **Seams**: Sealant applied full depth, no voids
- **Fastener pattern**: Per product spacing, no missing fasteners
- **Transitions**: Wall-to-roof, wall-to-foundation sealed and lapped
- **Photo documentation**: Critical junctions, penetrations, transitions

- **Width**: 1/4 inch minimum
- **Closure**: Backer rod + sealant or specialized control joint product
- **Expansion joints**: At floor lines (multi-story), above and below window/door openings
- **Substrate**: Wire mesh, 3/8" base coat minimum, finish coat per spec
- **Curing**: Time before foot traffic varies (typically 7-14 days); protect from rain during cure

### Fiber Cement Boards
- **Grade clearance**: Minimum 6 inches above finished grade (prevents capillary moisture uptake)
- **Horizontal surfaces**: Minimum 2 inches clearance above gutters, roof lines, or parapet edges
- **Fastening**: Per manufacturer spacing (typically 8-16" OC)

- **End joints**: Staggered (not continuous), sealant applied to butt joints
- **Fastener heads**: Sealed to prevent water entry
- **Flashing**: Under eaves, around openings, at transitions

### All Cladding Systems: Common Requirements
- **Drainage plane**: Air space or drainage mat behind cladding (allows bulk water drainage)
- **Flashing at transitions**: Where cladding meets roof, foundation, windows, doors, dissimilar materials
- **Sealant schedule**: Joints sealed per specification; sealant type compatible to substrates
- **Slope**: Ensure positive drainage (no horizontal ledges that trap water)
- **Movement accommodation**: Metal/composite materials expand/contract; use sliding clips, not rigid fasteners

## Summary: Always Reference Manufacturer Instructions and Project Specifications

**These field standards represent common practice and typical code requirements. Every project has specific details:**
- Project architect determines system type and detail requirements
- Building code may be more stringent (climate zone, occupancy type, local amendments)
- Manufacturer installation instructions are binding and may override general guidance
- Soil and site conditions (water table, drainage, soil type) may require system modifications

**When in doubt: Check the specifications and call the architect or engineer.**
