## 1. EXCAVATOR SELECTION

### Size Classes & Trench Depth Relationships

| Machine Class | Operating Weight | Typical Bucket | Recommended Max Depth |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mini (Thumb class) | 1-6 ton | 0.1-0.3 CY | 4-6 ft |
| Midi | 7-10 ton | 0.3-0.5 CY | 6-8 ft |
| Standard | 10-45 ton | 0.5-1.5 CY | 8-14 ft |
| Large | 50+ ton | 1.5-4.0 CY | 14-20+ ft |

### Depth-Based Sizing Rules

- **8-foot trench**: Minimum 20-ton class excavator
  - 24-ton standard excavator with 0.7 CY bucket typical choice
  - Verify slope angle; steeper slopes require smaller buckets at depth

- **12-foot trench**: 30-ton class minimum
  - 30-35 ton with 1.0-1.2 CY bucket
  - Loader backup necessary for loading trucks at depth

- **16-foot+ trench**: 45-50+ ton required
  - Verify equipment will fit; site width constraints common
  - Confirm outrigger pads and ground bearing capacity
  - Smaller bucket necessary (0.75-1.0 CY) despite machine size

### Bucket Sizing by Trench Width

| Trench Width | Bucket Width Rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 2-3 feet | Bucket ≤ trench width minus 6" | 24-30" bucket for 3' trench |
| 3-4 feet | Bucket 36-42" | 42" standard |
| 4-6 feet | Bucket 48-60" | 60" typical |
| 6+ feet | Multiple bucket widths or loader work | Loader preferred |

### Track vs. Wheel Considerations

**Tracks (Standard for excavators)**
- Ground bearing pressure: 5-8 psi (soft soil, wetland work)
- Slower mobility, better traction
- Floats in wet conditions
- Requires lowboy transport (40-ton flatbed typical)
- Repair cost: high (seal replacements, track wear)

**Wheels (Less common, mobile equipment)**
- Ground bearing pressure: 15-25 psi (compacted ground only)
- Self-mobile, faster site to site
- Cannot work in mud, wet soils
- Road-legal on most equipment
- Better for multiple small sites
- Use only on proven competent soil

**Field Decision**: Tracks default unless site conditions dry and stable, and mobilization costs justify wheels.

### Thumb Attachment

- Cost: +$3,500-8,000 rental, +$6,000-15,000 purchase
- **Use for**: utility excavation (electrical conduits, telecom, gas), drainage work, material separation
- **Do NOT use for**: production excavation (slows cycle time ~15%), structural foundation digging
- Thumb rotation requires proportional hydraulic valves (confirm availability with operator)

## 2. DOZER SELECTION

### Size Classes by Production and Material

| Class | Model Range | Operating Weight | Push Distance Sweet Spot |
|---|---|---|---|
| Small | D3, D4 | 15-25 ton | 50-150 feet |
| Medium | D5, D6 | 35-50 ton | 100-300 feet |
| Large | D7, D8 | 60-100+ ton | 200-500+ feet |
| Extra Large | D9, D11 | 100-150+ ton | 500+ feet |

### Push Distance Rule of Thumb

**Larger machines for longer pushes.** Dozer efficiency drops sharply beyond optimal push distance:
- D3/D4: Inefficient beyond 100 feet (use loader instead)
- D5: 100-200 feet optimal
- D6: 150-300 feet optimal
- D7: 200-400 feet optimal
- D8+: 300+ feet

*Reason*: Horsepower and traction degrade over distance; production loss >20% indicates wrong machine size.

### Blade Types & Applications

| Blade Type | Width | Best Use | Avoid |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S-Blade (Straight)** | Full dozer width (10-12 ft) | General push (fill, grading), hard material, rock | Loose, fluffy material (sand blows out) |
| **U-Blade (Universal)** | Curved sides, holds material | Loose fill, sand, topsoil, long push | Rock, hard clay (binding) |
| **SU-Blade (Semi-Universal)** | Hybrid shape | Versatile (general use) | None; slower than specialized blades |

**Field Rule**: Use S-blade for structured fill and hard material. Switch to U-blade for loose, fluffy material or material with wind concerns.

### Material Type Considerations

- **Clay, cohesive soil**: S-blade efficient; watch for blade binding
- **Rock, hard material**: Ripper first (break with dozer ripper attachment), then dozer push with S-blade
- **Sandy fill, loose material**: U-blade mandatory to prevent loss
- **Mixed excavation**: SU-blade compromise (slower but reliable across material types)

## 3. CRANE SELECTION

### Crane Type Comparison

| Type | Capacity | Mobility | Setup | Cost | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mobile Crane** | 50-600 ton | Self-propelled, road legal | 30 min + outriggers | $$$ | Single heavy lifts, good road access, limited floor space |
| **Rough Terrain Crane** | 25-300 ton | Self-propelled, unpaved | 20 min + outriggers | $$ | Jobsite to jobsite, unimproved access, versatile |
| **Tower Crane** | 50-500+ ton | Stationary | 2-3 days setup | $$$$ | High-rise, sustained multiple lifts, permanent at location |
| **Crawler Crane** | 100-1000+ ton | Track mobile, very slow | 4-8 hours setup | $$$ | Heavy lifts, no outrigger pads needed, poor road access |

### Load Chart Reading Essentials

**Three key variables**:
1. **Boom length** — measured from center pin (typical 40-200 feet)
2. **Radius** — horizontal distance from crane centerline to load center (measured on jobsite)
3. **Capacity** — **ALWAYS DECREASES as radius increases**

**Load Chart Example: 100-ton Liebherr Mobile Crane**
```
Boom 100 ft:
  @ 20 ft radius  = 100 ton capacity (max)
  @ 50 ft radius  = 60 ton capacity
  @ 80 ft radius  = 40 ton capacity
  @ 100 ft radius = 20 ton capacity
```

**Field Rule**: Measure radius carefully. Use tape measure from crane centerline to load pickup point. Add rigging weight (slings, spreader bar) to load weight before consulting chart. **Never exceed rated capacity at that radius.**

### Common Lift Weights & Rigging Deductions

**Structural Steel** (Use erection drawings for piece weights)
- Typical W36x300 wide flange beam: ~17,000 lbs per 40 ft length
- Steel decking (1.5" normal weight): ~50 lbs/SF
- Allow 5-10% rigging weight (spreader bars, slings)

**Concrete Components**
- 1 CY concrete bucket: ~4,000-5,000 lbs empty
- Concrete weighs ~150 lbs/CF (normal weight), so 1 CY = ~4,050 lbs
- Double-tee precast @ 24" depth, 40 ft long: ~8,000-10,000 lbs
- Concrete pier (18" dia. x 20' high): ~12,000-15,000 lbs

**HVAC/MEP Units**
- Rooftop HVAC unit (10-20 ton capacity): 3,000-8,000 lbs
- Confirm weight with submittal; spec sheets often understate rigging weight
- Add 500-1,000 lbs for rigging hardware

**Rigging Weight Deductions** (add to load weight before chart lookup)
- Single sling pair: ~100 lbs
- Spreader bar (4-point rigging): ~300-600 lbs
- Shackles, hooks, chains: ~50-200 lbs total
- **Rule**: Add 10% of load weight as rigging allowance if actual rigging specs unavailable

### Outrigger Pad Requirements

**Ground bearing pressure limits**:
- Standard pad: 20 psi maximum (compact compacted soils only)
- Extended pad (larger surface area): 10-15 psi for soft soils
- Poor soil (clay, sand, uncompacted): Mat system required (2-4" plywood + blocking)

**Field verification**:
- Test soil bearing at outrigger location before crane arrives
- If poor bearing suspected, use 2-4' x 4' x 4" plywood mats minimum
- Wet soil = mat required, even if test appears adequate
- Compact subgrade 3-4" before placing mats

**Tip-over risk**: Outriggers not fully extended or pads settling = catastrophic failure. Verify ground before lift sequence.

## 4. LOADER SELECTION

### Wheel Loader Bucket Sizing

| Bucket Size | Application | Typical Weight (empty) | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.5-2.5 CY | Small site, material separating | 400-600 lbs | Gravel, mulch, light demolition |
| 3.0-4.5 CY | Standard production | 600-900 lbs | General fill, excavated material, aggregate |
| 5.0+ CY | Large quantity, long haul | 1,000+ lbs | Soil moving, bulk fill |

**Bucket selection rule**: Match bucket size to truck capacity. 4.0 CY loader fills standard 10-CY dump truck in ~3 passes (ideal). Oversized bucket = wasted time backing up to finish load.

### Equipment Decision Tree

```
START: Material handling task

├─ Confined space (interior, tight access)?
│  └─ YES → Skid Steer (small footprint, tight turning radius)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ Vertical travel >6 feet?
│  └─ YES → Boom Lift (articulating arm)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ Production hauling 4+ hours/day?
│  └─ YES → Wheel Loader (fuel efficiency, speed)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
└─ Must handle rough terrain, frozen ground?
   └─ YES → Compact Track Loader (traction, flotation)
   └─ NO → Wheel Loader (faster, lower cost)
```

### Attachment Versatility

**Standard Attachments** (most useful field sequence):
1. **Bucket** (primary)
2. **Forks** (material stacks, pallet handling) — cost +$1,500-3,000
3. **Grapple** (demolition, brush clearing) — cost +$3,000-6,000
4. **Auger** (hole boring, utility clearance) — cost +$4,000-8,000

**Field rule**: Bucket + forks cover 80% of loader needs. Add grapple if demolition phase heavy. Auger only if sustained boring work (3+ weeks).

## 5. COMPACTOR SELECTION

### Compactor Type by Soil & Lift Thickness

| Compactor Type | Best Soil | Max Lift Thickness | Typical Use | Speed (MPH) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Vibratory Smooth Drum** | Granular (sand, gravel) | 6-8" | Subgrade, base preparation | 3-4 |
| **Padfoot / Sheepsfoot** | Cohesive (clay, silt) | 8-12" | Fill compaction | 2-3 |
| **Vibratory Plate** | Granular, confined spaces | 4-6" | Trenches, small areas | 2-3 |
| **Pneumatic Roller** | Asphalt | 2-3" per pass | Asphalt finish rolling | 5-7 |

### Application-Specific Rules

**Subgrade preparation** (below finished grade):
- Use smooth drum vibratory, 6" lifts
- Achieve 95% Standard Proctor density (verify with test boring)
- Typically requires 4-6 passes per lift

**Structural fill (embankment, general fill)**:
- Use padfoot drum, 8-10" lifts, 95%+ density required
- Padfoot breaks clay chunks, allows interlocking of soil particles
- Cohesive soils (clay) compact harder than granular (sand)

**Utility trench backfill**:
- Use vibratory plate (fits in trench), 4-6" lifts
- Granular material: sand/gravel (easier compaction)
- Do NOT use large drums (cannot fit, compacts unevenly)

**Asphalt finish rolling**:
- Use pneumatic roller (tire pressure = compaction)
- Smooth drum secondary (cooling, sealing)
- Temperature critical: roll between 300-350°F (too cool = poor consolidation)

### Ground Bearing Pressure (Equipment Selection Impact)

- Smooth drum: 10-15 psi (floats well)
- Padfoot: 20-30 psi (concentrated pressure under feet)
- Vibratory plate: 30-50 psi (compact, concentrated)
- Pneumatic roller: 60-100 psi (tires)

**Field decision**: Soft subgrade (wet clay) = smooth drum. Hard granular = padfoot.

## 6. DEWATERING PUMP SELECTION

### Pump Type Comparison

| Type | Flow Rate | Head Capacity | Best Use | Debris Tolerance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Submersible** | 10-500 GPM | 200+ feet | Sump, deep excavation | Low (must be clean water) |
| **Centrifugal** | 100-2,000 GPM | 150 feet typical | Trenches, jobsite runoff | Medium (clogging risk) |
| **Diaphragm (Trash Pump)** | 50-500 GPM | 150 feet | Dirty water, solids slurry | High (handles 3" solids) |
| **Wellpoint System** | 50-200 GPM total | 30 feet typical | Sustained dewatering, clay | Low (filter media) |

### Sizing by Flow Rate & Head

**Flow Rate Calculation**:
- Excavation inflow rate = groundwater table elevation ± seasonal variation
- Site geology determines inflow: sandy soil = 2-3 GPM/SF; clay = 0.5-1 GPM/SF
- Rule of thumb: Estimate inflow, size pump at 1.5x-2x inflow rate (safety margin for peak)

**Head Calculation**:
- Head = vertical distance from pump to discharge + friction loss in hose
- Example: 15-foot-deep sump, discharge 50 feet away horizontally
  - Vertical head = 15 feet
  - Friction loss in hose ~5 feet per 100 feet length
  - Total head = 15 + 2.5 = 17.5 feet
- Do NOT undersize for head; capacity drops significantly as head increases

### Pump Capacity Charts (Field Reference)

**3" Centrifugal Pump (typical jobsite)**
- @ 10 feet head: 250 GPM
- @ 20 feet head: 180 GPM
- @ 30 feet head: 120 GPM
- @ 50 feet head: 60 GPM

**Trash Pump (diaphragm, 2" discharge)**
- @ 10 feet head: 150 GPM
- @ 20 feet head: 100 GPM
- @ 30 feet head: 70 GPM

### Trash Pump vs. Centrifugal Decision

**Use Trash Pump if**:
- Water contains silt, sand, mud, concrete slurry (dirty water)
- Debris in sump likely (trash, sticks, small rocks)
- Clogging unacceptable (only 1 pump available)
- Cost justified by reliability

**Use Centrifugal if**:
- Water relatively clean (groundwater from sand, rock)
- Intake filtered (sump with strainer)
- Cost-sensitive, temporary dewatering only

### Wellpoint Systems (Sustained Dewatering)

**When to use**:
- Foundation excavation >15 feet requiring continuous dewatering
- Utility tunnel work, long-duration water management
- Prevents lateral soil migration, maintains stability

**System components**:
- Wellpoint lines (2" dia., perforated intake)
- Header pipe (manifold connecting all points)
- Pump (centrifugal or submersible, typically 100-200 GPM)
- Filter media (sand pack around point)

**Field rule**: Wellpoint reduces water table ~3-5 feet (depth depends on soil permeability). Space points 4-8 feet apart. Monitor piezometer readings to confirm drawdown effectiveness.

**Cost**: $200-500/wellpoint installed + pumping labor. Justified for >4-week dewatering duration.

## 7. GENERATOR SELECTION

### Sizing by Connected Load

**Connected Load Calculation**:
1. List all loads that might run simultaneously (worst-case scenario)
2. Add individual kW ratings
3. Apply diversity factor (not all loads run at once)
4. Multiply by 1.2 (20% safety margin, standard practice)

**Formula**:
```
Required Generator Size = (Total Connected Load × Diversity Factor) × 1.2
```

**Diversity Factors** (percentage of connected load running simultaneously):
- Temporary power only (lights, tools): 0.6-0.7 (60-70% connected)
- Mixed (power + welding): 0.5-0.6
- Heating, cooling, compressors: 0.4-0.5 (high inrush current)

### Common Construction Loads (kW)

| Equipment | Typical Load | Startup Inrush |
|---|---|---|
| **Welding** | | |
| - Stick welder (250 amp) | 12-15 kW | 1.5x running load |
| - MIG welder (200 amp) | 8-12 kW | 1.3x |
| - Plasma cutter | 15-25 kW | High (confirm size) |
| **Power Tools** | | |
| - Large rotary compressor | 3-5 kW | 2-3x startup |
| - Handheld power tools (mixed) | 1-3 kW | 1.2x |
| **Lighting** | | |
| - LED light string (4 fixtures) | 0.5-1 kW | Minimal |
| - Halogen/HPS string (4 fixtures) | 2-4 kW | Minimal |
| - Temp trailer (office, lights, outlets) | 5-8 kW | 1.5x startup |
| **HVAC** | | |
| - Space heater (large) | 10-15 kW | High inrush |
| - Portable AC unit | 3-5 kW | 2-3x startup |
| **Miscellaneous** | | |
| - Concrete pump | 20-30 kW | High startup |
| - DeWalt dust collector | 2-4 kW | 2x startup |

### Generator Sizing Example

**Scenario**: Excavation site with:
- 2 welders (12 kW each)
- Temp trailer (6 kW)
- Lighting strings (3 kW)
- Compressor (4 kW)
- Misc. tools (2 kW)

Calculation:
```
Total connected load = 12 + 12 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 39 kW
Diversity factor (not all welders + compressor simultaneous) = 0.6
Base load = 39 × 0.6 = 23.4 kW
Safety margin = 23.4 × 1.2 = 28 kW required

Recommendation: 35 kW generator (provides 25% margin above calculated)
```

### Single vs. Three-Phase Decision

**Single Phase** (most common):
- Standard 120/240V residential service
- Sufficient for <50 kW loads
- Lower cost, wider availability
- Most tools/heaters single-phase

**Three Phase** (400V, 480V available):
- Required for large motors (compressors >10 kW, pumps)
- Better efficiency, smoother power delivery
- Larger equipment availability, better pricing
- Mandatory for industrial loads

**Field rule**: Ask equipment rental what power it needs. Most jobsites <30 kW use single-phase. Larger sites transition to three-phase.

## 8. AERIAL LIFT SELECTION

### Lift Type by Task Requirements

| Lift Type | Max Height | Horizontal Reach | Vertical Only | Indoor Safe | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Scissor Lift** | 20-40 feet | None (straight up) | YES | YES (electric avail.) | $ |
| **Boom Lift (Articulating)** | 40-60 feet | 30-45 feet horizontal | NO | NO | $$ |
| **Boom Lift (Telescoping)** | 60-150 feet | 30-50 feet horizontal | NO | NO | $$$ |
| **Telehandler (Boom Forklift)** | 40-60 feet | 20-35 feet horizontal | NO | Limited (fuel only) | $$ |

### Selection Decision Tree

```
Task: Personnel or material placement at height?

├─ Personnel only, slab work (interior)?
│  └─ Scissor Lift (safest, most stable, electric available)
│
├─ Personnel, need horizontal reach (wall work, facade)?
│  └─ Articulating Boom Lift (smooth motion, tight areas)
│
├─ Very high reach (>60 feet)?
│  └─ Telescoping Boom Lift (extended reach, single operator)
│
└─ Material placement + personnel basket (MEP, finishes)?
   └─ Telehandler (material load capacity, mobility)
```

### Typical Reach Requirements by Task

- **Drywall/tape installation (walls)**: 16-20 feet height, 10-15 feet horizontal reach
  - Solution: 40-foot articulating boom lift

- **Facade/curtainwall**: 20-60 feet height, 20-30 feet reach
  - Solution: 60-foot telescoping boom or articulating boom (multiples)

- **HVAC placement (roof 30 feet)**: 30-40 feet vertical
  - Solution: Telehandler preferred (load capacity for 5-ton unit), or boom lift

- **Interior slab work (concrete finishing)**: 8-20 feet height, no horizontal reach
  - Solution: Scissor lift (most cost-effective, smoothest platform)

### Safety Considerations

- **Ground bearing**: Boom lifts 30-80 psi (soft soil = mats required)
- **Wind speed limits**: Most lifts restricted >30 mph winds (check specs)
- **Outriggers**: Must be fully extended and on pads (no exceptions)
- **Platform load limits**: 500-1,000 lbs typical (includes worker weight + tools)

## 9. MOBILIZATION CONSIDERATIONS

### Transport Weight Limits & Equipment Matching

| Equipment | Operating Weight | Transport Weight | Lowboy Required? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Excavator (35 ton class) | 35 ton | 40-50 ton | YES (40-ton) | Tracks add weight vs. wheels |
| Dozer (D6) | 45 ton | 50-60 ton | YES (50-ton) | Largest standard lowboy capacity |
| Wheeled Loader (4.5 CY) | 30 ton | 35-40 ton | Maybe (standard flatbed) | Self-mobile if short distance |
| Compactor (padfoot, 20 ton) | 20 ton | 25-30 ton | Maybe | Transport on standard flatbed |
| Crane (50-ton mobile) | 50 ton | 70-100 ton | Specialized trailer | Ultra-heavy haul required |

### Standard Transport Equipment

- **Lowboy flatbed trailer**: 40-50 ton capacity, 8' 6" deck width
  - Cost: $150-250/hour (2-4 hours typical delivery)
  - Dimensions: 48-53 feet long, fits most equipment

- **Standard flatbed**: 20-30 ton capacity, 8' wide deck
  - Cost: $80-120/hour
  - Best for loaders, compactors, smaller equipment

- **Specialized ultra-heavy trailers**: 100+ tons (cranes, tunnel equipment)
  - Cost: $500-1,500/haul (specialized pricing)

### Site Access Width & Clearance Requirements

**Minimum Roadway Width**:
- Excavator (standard): 12 feet (with side mirrors)
- Dozer: 13-14 feet (wide blade)
- Mobile crane: 13 feet (wheelbase and outriggers)
- Rough terrain crane: 12 feet

**Field verification**:
- Measure narrowest point from property line to property line
- Add 1-2 feet clearance for driver safety (obstacles)
- If access restricted, confirm equipment will fit **before** rental ordered
- Tight access = upgrade cost (smaller equipment, longer schedule)

**Overhead Clearances**:
- Boom lifts (raised): 45-60 feet horizontal projection overhead
- Cranes (raised): Confirm clearance above boom path
- Measure power lines, building overhangs
- Establish restricted zones (flagged areas, spotters)

### Ground Bearing Pressure & Soft Soil Conditions

**Bearing Pressure by Equipment** (empty):
- Wheeled loader: 15-20 psi
- Excavator (tracks): 5-8 psi (flotation advantage)
- Dozer (tracks): 6-10 psi
- Compactor: 20-30 psi (concentrated)
- Crane outriggers: 30-50 psi concentrated (pads required)

**Soft Soil Mitigation**:
- Test bearing capacity at entrance, main paths, parking areas
- Clay soils <6" penetration under test load = mat system required
- Mat system: 2-4" plywood over 2x6 lumber base, 20x20 feet minimum area
- Cost: $2,000-5,000 mat system installation + maintenance
- Maintenance: Inspect weekly, reset settling mats, add drainage if pooling

**Field rule**: If doubt exists on bearing capacity, install mats. Cost of mats (low) << Cost of equipment stuck/damaged (very high).

---

## UNIVERSAL FIELD RULES

1. **Project specifications override all guidelines** — Always consult approved submittals, geotechnical reports, and contract specifications before final equipment selection.

2. **Site conditions determine everything** — Soil type, groundwater, access, slopes, weather all critical. Visit site before ordering equipment.

3. **Operator experience matters** — Equipment selection includes operator capability (crane certification, equipment-specific training). Under-qualified operator = inefficiency, safety risk.

4. **Peak season rental costs** — Prices 20-40% higher spring/summer; budget accordingly for off-season work.

5. **Transport time included** — Lowboy delivery often 2-8 hours each direction. Plan mobilization time in schedule, not day-of.

6. **Insurance & bonding** — Verify equipment insurance requirements in contract (some equipment may require additional coverage).

## 10. CRANE INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS

### Daily Inspection Checklist

Every crane must be inspected by a competent person before each shift per OSHA 1926.1412(d). The following items must be checked and documented:

**Structural Inspection**
- Visual check of main structural members for cracks, deformation, corrosion
- Inspect turntable bearing and bolts for looseness
- Check counterweight mounting bolts and securing pins
- Verify boom rest and stow pins functional
- Look for weld cracks at stress points (boom foot, mast connection, A-frame)

**Wire Rope Inspection**
- Check for broken wires: no more than 6 randomly distributed broken wires in one rope lay, or 3 broken wires in one strand in one rope lay (running ropes)
- Diameter reduction: no more than 1/64" per original diameter below nominal (e.g., 3/4" rope cannot be below 23/32")
- Inspect for corrosion: surface pitting, discoloration, stiffness
- Check for kinking, birdcaging, crushing, or core protrusion
- Verify proper lubrication (dry rope = accelerated wear)
- Inspect rope terminations: wedge sockets, swaged fittings, clips

**Hook and Block Inspection**
- Throat opening measurement: compare to manufacturer baseline; if increased >15% from original, hook must be replaced
- Check for twist: hook rotated >10 degrees from plane of unbent hook = replace
- Inspect for cracks: magnetic particle or dye penetrant testing annually
- Safety latch functional and spring-loaded
- Hook nut and cotter pin secure
- Swivel bearing rotates freely without binding
- Block sheaves rotate freely; check for rope groove wear

**Boom Inspection**
- Visual straightness check (sight down boom; any deflection = further investigation)
- Pin holes: check for elongation or deformation at connection points
- Sheave condition: groove wear, cracking, bearing play
- Boom stops and anti-two-block devices functional
- Pendants and gantry properly tensioned
- Lattice boom: inspect lacings for cracks, bent members, missing bolts

**Outrigger Inspection**
- Extend and retract each outrigger beam: smooth operation, no binding
- Check cylinder seals for leaks (hydraulic fluid on beam = seal failure)
- Float pads: inspect for cracks, bending, proper pin retention
- Outrigger beam pins: check for wear, proper seating
- Level indicators (bubble levels) accurate and readable

**Controls Inspection**
- All control levers return to neutral when released
- No erratic movement or drift when controls released
- Hydraulic system: check fluid level, filter condition, hose routing
- Electrical: all indicator lights functional, LMI (Load Moment Indicator) operational
- Emergency stop button accessible and functional

**Safety Devices**
- Load Moment Indicator (LMI): verify calibration, display readable, alarms functional
- Anti-two-block device: test warning and lockout function
- Boom angle indicator: reads correctly at known positions
- Level indicator: crane must be within 1% of level
- Swing brake: holds crane from rotating when engaged
- Boom hoist pawl: engages and holds boom in raised position

### Monthly Inspection

All daily inspection items performed in greater detail, plus:
- **Load testing documentation**: review last load test date; verify within 12 months
- **Hydraulic system**: complete fluid analysis if due; check all cylinder rods for scoring
- **Electrical system**: test all limit switches, proximity sensors, interlocks
- **Structural bolts**: torque check on critical connections (turntable, counterweight, boom pins)
- **Rope replacement tracking**: log total operating hours on each wire rope
- **Brake testing**: verify all brakes hold at rated load (swing, hoist, boom hoist)
- **Documentation**: file monthly inspection report with equipment records

### Annual Inspection

**Third-party certification required per OSHA 1926.1412(f)**:
- Must be performed by a qualified person (not the operator or daily inspector)
- Comprehensive structural inspection including NDT (non-destructive testing) where specified
- Complete review of all safety devices, interlocks, and limiting systems
- Wire rope replacement assessment per manufacturer criteria
- Hook NDT (magnetic particle or dye penetrant)

## 11. EQUIPMENT SAFETY -- OSHA REQUIREMENTS

### Guarding Requirements for All Equipment

**ROPS (Roll-Over Protective Structure)**
- Required on all dozers, loaders, scrapers, and other equipment subject to rollover
- Must meet SAE J1040 or ISO 3471 standards
- Field verification: check for cracks, loose bolts, deformation after any impact event
- Never modify or remove ROPS without manufacturer approval

**FOPS (Falling Object Protective Structure)**
- Required when equipment operates in areas where falling objects are a hazard
- Common applications: excavators near demolition, loaders under overhead work, cranes
- Must meet SAE J231 or ISO 3449 standards
- ROPS/FOPS combination structures available on most modern equipment

**Seat Belts**
- Required in all equipment with ROPS per OSHA 1926.602
- Must be worn at all times during operation
- Inspect webbing for fraying, buckle for proper latching, anchor points for looseness

**Backup Alarms**
- Required on all equipment that has obstructed rear view per OSHA 1926.602(a)(9)
- Alarm must be audible above surrounding noise level
- Test alarm function daily during pre-operation inspection
- Alternative: trained spotter assigned whenever equipment reverses

### Lockout/Tagout for Equipment Maintenance (OSHA 1910.147 Applied to Construction)

**When required:**
- Any maintenance or servicing where unexpected startup could cause injury
- Changing attachments (buckets, blades) where hydraulic energy stored
- Working on or near power take-off (PTO) components
- Electrical system repair or modification

**Procedure:**
1. Notify all affected employees of pending lockout
2. Shut down equipment using normal stopping procedure
3. Isolate all energy sources: ignition off, key removed, hydraulics de-pressurized, battery disconnected if electrical work
4. Apply lock and tag at each energy isolation point
5. Verify zero energy: attempt to start (should not), cycle hydraulic controls (should not move), test electrical circuits (should be dead)
6. Perform maintenance/service
7. Remove locks/tags only by the person who applied them
8. Verify all personnel clear before re-energizing

**Field rule**: One lock per person. If multiple workers servicing same machine, each worker applies their own lock. Machine cannot restart until ALL locks removed.

### Equipment Operator Qualification and Certification

**Crane operators**: Must be certified per OSHA 1926.1427
- Certification by accredited testing organization (NCCCO, CIC, NCCER, or OECP)
- Type and capacity specific (e.g., certified for mobile crane up to 100 tons)
- Medical fitness evaluation required
- Certification renewal per certifying body requirements (typically every 5 years)

**Heavy equipment operators** (excavators, dozers, loaders):
- No federal certification required, but competent person evaluation required
- Employer must verify operator can safely operate specific equipment type
- Document training and evaluation records
- Some states/jurisdictions require licensing (verify local requirements)

**Aerial lift operators**:
- Training required per OSHA 1926.453
- Must be trained on specific type of lift to be used
- Documented training record maintained by employer
- Retraining required after observed unsafe operation or new equipment type

### Blind Spot Awareness and Spotter Requirements

**When spotters required:**
- Equipment operating in areas with pedestrian traffic
- Backing operations where rear view is obstructed
- Working near structures, utilities, or other equipment
- Any time operator cannot see the full path of travel

**Spotter protocol:**
- Spotter positioned where visible to operator at all times
- Pre-agreed hand signals (standard per OSHA or site-specific)
- Spotter maintains safe distance (outside swing/crush radius)
- Eye contact maintained before any movement
- Spotter has stop authority (any worker can stop any operation for safety)

**Blind spot zones by equipment type:**
- Excavator: directly behind cab, low areas around tracks, inside swing radius
- Dozer: directly behind blade, low areas on both sides
- Loader: behind bucket when raised, both sides during travel
- Crane: under boom, behind counterweight, inside swing radius

### Equipment Pre-Operation Inspection (Walk-Around)

**Required per OSHA 1926.602 before each shift:**

**Exterior walk-around (clockwise from operator door):**
1. Tires/tracks: condition, pressure, tension, damage
2. Undercarriage: leaks, loose components, debris
3. Hydraulic hoses: routing, chafing, leaks, fittings tight
4. Engine compartment: fluid levels (oil, coolant, hydraulic), belt condition, air filter
5. Attachments: secure mounting, pin retention, cutting edge wear
6. Lights and mirrors: clean, functional, properly aimed
7. Cab: clean windshield, mirrors adjusted, controls accessible
8. Safety devices: backup alarm test, horn, emergency stops

**In-cab checks:**
1. Seat and seat belt: adjusted, latched, functional
2. All controls: neutral position, proper function at idle
3. Gauges: oil pressure, temperature, hydraulic pressure, fuel level
4. Warning lights: all illuminate at key-on, then extinguish
5. Brakes: service brake holds, parking brake holds
6. Steering: responsive, no excessive play

**Documentation**: Complete pre-operation inspection form; file daily; retain for project duration.

## 12. COLD AND HOT WEATHER EQUIPMENT MODIFICATIONS

### Cold Weather Operations (Below 32 degrees F)

**Block Heaters**
- Install engine block heaters on all diesel equipment when overnight temperatures drop below 20 degrees F
- Connect heaters 2-4 hours before planned startup (timer recommended)
- Cost: $50-150 per heater installed; electricity cost minimal
- Without block heater: cold starts cause excessive engine wear, slow hydraulic response, battery drain

**Fuel Additives**
- Add anti-gel additive to diesel fuel when temperatures drop below 15 degrees F
- Diesel fuel gels (waxes) at approximately 10-15 degrees F (cloud point varies by fuel blend)
- Use winter-blend diesel (#1 diesel or #1/#2 blend) when available
- Keep fuel tanks full overnight (reduces condensation = less water in fuel)
- Drain water separators daily in cold weather

**Hydraulic Fluid Viscosity**
- Cold hydraulic fluid thickens: slow response, cavitation risk, seal damage
- Allow 5-10 minute warm-up at low idle before operating controls
- If extreme cold (below 0 degrees F): switch to lower viscosity hydraulic fluid per manufacturer recommendation
- Never operate at full speed/pressure until fluid reaches operating temperature (typically 100-120 degrees F)

**Tire Pressure**
- Tire pressure drops approximately 1 PSI for every 10 degrees F temperature drop
- Check and adjust tire pressure when cold (before operation)
- Under-inflated tires: increased rolling resistance, uneven wear, potential bead unseating
- Over-inflated in cold: risk of cracking (rubber less flexible when cold)

**Battery Care**
- Battery capacity drops approximately 50% at 0 degrees F
- Test batteries before winter season (load test)
- Keep terminals clean and tight (corrosion increases resistance)
- Store backup batteries in heated space
- Jump-start procedure: connect positive first, negative to engine block (not battery terminal), allow charging before cranking

**Additional Cold Weather Items**
- Coolant: verify antifreeze protection level (hydrometer test); protect to -20 degrees F minimum
- Tracks: frozen ground can damage track pads; operate carefully on frost heaves
- Windshield: keep washer fluid rated for cold; verify defrosters functional
- Grease: cold grease does not flow to bearings; grease all points after warm-up

### Hot Weather Operations (Above 90 degrees F)

**Cooling System Maintenance**
- Inspect radiator and oil cooler fins daily: clean debris (dust, insects, leaves)
- Check coolant level when cold (before shift start)
- Verify fan belt tension and condition
- Monitor engine temperature gauge closely; shut down if approaching red zone
- Ensure radiator cap holds proper pressure (test with cap tester annually)

**Tire Blowout Prevention**
- Tire pressure increases approximately 1 PSI for every 10 degrees F temperature rise
- Check tire pressure when cold; do not bleed air from hot tires
- Reduce speed on hot pavement (heat buildup from friction + ambient)
- Inspect tires for bulges, sidewall cracking, tread separation
- Avoid prolonged parking on hot asphalt (heat soak damages tires)

**Operator Heat Stress**
- Verify cab air conditioning functional before hot weather season
- Provide shade structures at operator break areas
- Enforce hydration protocol: minimum 1 quart of water per hour in extreme heat
- Recognize heat stress signs: dizziness, confusion, heavy sweating then no sweating, rapid pulse
- Emergency protocol: move to shade, cool with water, call medical if symptoms severe
- OSHA recommends work/rest schedules when heat index exceeds 90 degrees F

**Additional Hot Weather Items**
- Hydraulic fluid: overheating causes fluid breakdown; monitor temperature gauge
- Fuel: diesel can develop algae/biological growth in hot tanks; use biocide if storage exceeds 30 days
- Electrical: heat accelerates wire insulation degradation; inspect for cracked insulation
- Ground conditions: dry soil = dust; use water truck for dust control, protect air filters

### Seasonal Transition Checklists

## EQUIPMENT PRODUCTION RATE TABLES

Understanding machine production rates is the foundation of answering the single most important equipment question on any job: "Which machine do I need, and how many of them?" These tables give you real numbers to work from. Always apply the efficiency factors at the end -- theoretical rates are what the machine CAN do; net rates are what it WILL do on your site.

### Excavator Production Rates

Production in loose cubic yards per hour (LCY/hr) by machine class, bucket size, and digging conditions.

| Machine Class | Operating Weight | Bucket Size (CY) | Cycle Time (sec) | Easy Digging (LCY/hr) | Medium Digging (LCY/hr) | Hard Digging (LCY/hr) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mini | <6 ton | 0.10-0.25 | 12-15 | 25-45 | 18-35 | 12-25 |
| Small | 6-15 ton | 0.25-0.60 | 14-18 | 50-95 | 40-75 | 30-55 |
| Medium | 15-30 ton | 0.60-1.25 | 16-22 | 100-180 | 80-140 | 55-100 |
| Large | 30-50 ton | 1.25-2.50 | 18-26 | 180-320 | 140-250 | 100-180 |
| Very Large | >50 ton | 2.50-5.00 | 22-30 | 300-550 | 230-430 | 160-300 |

**Digging Condition Definitions**
- **Easy**: Loose soil, sand, gravel, previously excavated material, no groundwater
- **Medium**: Common earth, packed soil, soft clay, minor groundwater seepage
- **Hard**: Stiff clay, cemented gravel, weathered rock, heavy groundwater, confined space

**Swing Angle Adjustment**
Rates above assume 90-degree swing to truck. Adjust for actual swing angle:
- 45 degrees: multiply by 1.15 (shorter cycle)
- 90 degrees: baseline (1.00)
- 120 degrees: multiply by 0.90
- 180 degrees: multiply by 0.78

**Depth Adjustment**
Digging deeper than 60% of maximum reach reduces production:
- 60-80% of max depth: multiply by 0.90
- 80-100% of max depth: multiply by 0.75

**Bank to Loose Conversion Factors (Swell Factors)**
Material is measured in Bank Cubic Yards (BCY) in place, but fills trucks as Loose Cubic Yards (LCY). Always convert when calculating truck loads.

| Material | Swell Factor | 1 BCY = LCY |
|---|---|---|
| Sand | 1.10-1.15 | 1.10-1.15 |
| Common Earth | 1.20-1.30 | 1.20-1.30 |
| Clay | 1.30-1.40 | 1.30-1.40 |
| Gravel | 1.12-1.18 | 1.12-1.18 |
| Blasted Rock | 1.50-1.70 | 1.50-1.70 |
| Broken Concrete | 1.40-1.60 | 1.40-1.60 |
| Topsoil | 1.15-1.25 | 1.15-1.25 |

**Practical Example**: You need to remove 1,000 BCY of clay. That is 1,000 x 1.35 = 1,350 LCY going into trucks. A 30-ton excavator producing 140 LCY/hr in medium digging will take roughly 1,350 / 140 = 9.6 hours, or about 1.25 working days at a 50-min/hr efficiency.

### Dozer Production Rates

Production in loose cubic yards per hour (LCY/hr) by blade type and push distance. All values assume level ground; adjust for grade below.

| Blade Type | Push Distance 50 ft | Push Distance 100 ft | Push Distance 150 ft | Push Distance 200 ft | Push Distance 250 ft | Push Distance 300 ft |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S-Blade (D4/D5) | 200-280 | 130-185 | 95-130 | 70-100 | 55-80 | 45-65 |
| S-Blade (D6/D7) | 400-550 | 270-370 | 190-260 | 140-200 | 115-160 | 95-130 |
| S-Blade (D8/D9) | 650-900 | 440-600 | 310-430 | 230-320 | 185-260 | 155-215 |
| U-Blade (D6/D7) | 550-750 | 370-500 | 260-350 | 195-265 | 155-215 | 130-175 |
| U-Blade (D8/D9) | 850-1150 | 575-775 | 400-545 | 300-410 | 245-330 | 200-275 |
| SU-Blade (D6/D7) | 480-650 | 320-435 | 225-305 | 170-230 | 135-185 | 110-150 |

**Key Point**: Production drops roughly 50% each time push distance doubles. A 200 ft push yields approximately half the production of a 100 ft push. If push distance exceeds 300 ft, it is almost always cheaper to switch to excavator and trucks or scrapers.

**Grade Adjustment Factors**
- Downhill push: add +20% production per 10% grade (gravity assists)
- Uphill push: subtract -20% production per 10% grade
- Maximum recommended dozer grade: 30% (approximately 3:1 slope)
- Side slope: do not operate dozers on side slopes exceeding 20%

**Visibility Adjustment Factors**
- Good visibility (clear weather, minimal dust): 1.00
- Moderate dust: 0.80
- Heavy dust, fog, or poor visibility: 0.70
- Night work with adequate lighting: 0.85
- Night work with poor lighting: 0.70

**Blade Selection Quick Reference**
- **S-Blade (Straight)**: General purpose, short to medium push, most versatile
- **U-Blade (Universal)**: Higher capacity, best for longer pushes in loose material, poor for side-casting
- **SU-Blade (Semi-Universal)**: Compromise between S and U, good for slot-dozing and medium push distances
- **Angle blade (A-blade)**: Side-casting, ditch backfill, road maintenance -- not for production pushing

### Loader Production Rates

Production in loose cubic yards per hour (LCY/hr) by bucket size and haul distance. Wheel loaders only; track loaders use dozer-like production methods.

| Bucket Size (CY) | Load & Dump Only (0-50 ft) | 100 ft Haul | 200 ft Haul | 300 ft Haul |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.5 | 90-120 | 70-95 | 50-70 | 35-50 |
| 2.0 | 120-160 | 95-130 | 70-95 | 50-70 |
| 2.5 | 150-200 | 120-160 | 85-115 | 60-85 |
| 3.0 | 180-240 | 140-190 | 100-140 | 75-100 |
| 3.5 | 210-280 | 165-220 | 120-160 | 85-115 |
| 4.0 | 240-320 | 190-250 | 135-180 | 100-135 |
| 5.0 | 290-385 | 230-305 | 165-220 | 120-160 |

**Optimum Haul Distance**: Wheel loaders are most efficient under 200 ft. Beyond 200 ft, switch to excavator loading trucks. Loaders hauling beyond 300 ft is nearly always uneconomical.

**Number of Loader Passes to Fill Truck**
Match bucket size to truck so you get 3-6 passes per truck. More than 6 passes per truck means the loader is too small or the truck is too large.

| Truck Capacity (CY) | 2.0 CY Bucket | 3.0 CY Bucket | 4.0 CY Bucket | 5.0 CY Bucket |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 CY | 5 passes | 4 passes | 3 passes | 2 passes |
| 14 CY | 7 passes | 5 passes | 4 passes | 3 passes |
| 16 CY | 8 passes | 6 passes | 4 passes | 4 passes |
| 20 CY | 10 passes | 7 passes | 5 passes | 4 passes |

### Compactor Production Rates

Production in compacted cubic yards per hour (CCY/hr) by machine type and lift thickness. Assumes required density is achieved in the listed number of passes.

| Machine Type | Lift Thickness | Passes Required | Width | Speed (mph) | CCY/hr |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Smooth Drum Vibratory (66") | 8 in | 4-6 | 5.5 ft | 2-4 | 250-450 |
| Smooth Drum Vibratory (84") | 10 in | 4-6 | 7.0 ft | 2-4 | 400-700 |
| Padfoot/Sheepsfoot (66") | 6 in | 4-8 | 5.5 ft | 2-3 | 150-350 |
| Padfoot/Sheepsfoot (84") | 8 in | 4-8 | 7.0 ft | 2-3 | 300-550 |
| Pneumatic (9-wheel) | 6-8 in | 3-5 | 6.0 ft | 3-6 | 350-600 |
| Plate Compactor (walk-behind) | 4 in | 3-4 | 1.5-2.0 ft | 1-2 | 15-30 |
| Jumping Jack/Rammer | 4 in | 3-4 | 1.0-1.5 ft | 0.5-1 | 5-15 |

**Compaction Method Selection by Material Type**

| Material Type | Primary Compactor | Secondary/Finish | Typical Passes | Lift Thickness |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Granular (sand, gravel) | Vibratory smooth drum | -- | 4-6 | 8-12 in |
| Cohesive (clay, silt) | Padfoot/sheepsfoot | Smooth drum (seal) | 6-8 | 6-8 in |
| Mixed (sandy clay) | Padfoot vibratory | Smooth drum | 4-6 | 6-10 in |
| Asphalt (breakdown) | Static smooth drum | -- | 3-4 | per mat thickness |
| Asphalt (intermediate) | Pneumatic | -- | 4-6 | per mat thickness |
| Asphalt (finish) | Static smooth drum | -- | 2-3 | per mat thickness |
| Trench backfill | Jumping jack/rammer | Plate compactor | 3-4 per lift | 4-6 in |
| Structural fill near walls | Plate compactor | -- | 3-4 per lift | 4 in |

**Important**: Cohesive soils (clay) should NOT be compacted with vibratory equipment. Vibration causes clay to pump and lose density. Use static padfoot or sheepsfoot rollers. The only exception is padfoot rollers with the vibration turned OFF for initial kneading, then static mode for finish.

### Efficiency Factors (Apply to All Theoretical Rates)

No machine works 60 minutes out of every hour. Apply these factors to the theoretical production rates above to get realistic daily output.

**Working Minutes per Hour**

| Condition | Minutes Worked per 60-min Hour | Factor | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Excellent | 55 min/hr | 0.92 | Well-managed site, experienced operators, minimal delays, steady material supply |
| Above Average | 50 min/hr | 0.83 | Normal conditions, good management, minor delays for repositioning and check-ins |
| Average | 45 min/hr | 0.75 | Typical job site, some coordination delays, periodic refueling and minor maintenance |
| Below Average | 40 min/hr | 0.67 | Difficult conditions, inexperienced operators, frequent delays, poor site layout |
| Poor | 35 min/hr | 0.58 | Congested site, rain delays, breakdown-prone equipment, poor coordination |

**Field Rule of Thumb**: For bid estimates, use 0.75 (45 min/hr). For scheduling existing work with known crews, use 0.83 (50 min/hr). For pessimistic planning, use 0.67 (40 min/hr). Do NOT use 0.92 unless you are running a well-oiled operation with premium equipment and your best operators.

**Operator Skill Factor**
- Excellent operator: 1.00 (the rates above assume a competent operator)
- Average operator: 0.85
- Inexperienced/green operator: 0.65-0.75

**Job Condition Factors** (multiply together with efficiency)
- Material factor: loose/easy = 1.00, average = 0.85, hard/tough = 0.70
- Weather: dry/clear = 1.00, light rain = 0.90, heavy rain = 0.70 (if working at all)
- Altitude: sea level to 3,000 ft = 1.00, 3,000-6,000 ft = 0.95, 6,000-10,000 ft = 0.85

**Combined Production Calculation**

Net Production = Theoretical Rate x Efficiency Factor x Operator Factor x Job Condition Factor

**Example**: A D6 dozer with U-blade pushing 150 ft in average conditions with an average operator:
- Theoretical production: 260-350 LCY/hr (use midpoint: 305)
- Efficiency: 0.75 (average 45 min/hr)
- Operator: 0.85 (average)
- Conditions: 0.85 (average material)
- Net production: 305 x 0.75 x 0.85 x 0.85 = 165 LCY/hr
- Daily production (8-hr day): 165 x 8 = 1,320 LCY

## HAULING CAPACITY AND TRUCK FLEET SIZING

Getting the truck fleet right is one of the biggest cost levers on an earthwork job. Too few trucks and your excavator sits idle -- you are paying for a $350/hr machine that is doing nothing. Too many trucks and they stack up waiting to load -- less costly per unit but the waste adds up fast. This section gives you the numbers to balance the fleet.

### Truck Capacity by Type

| Truck Type | Struck Capacity (CY) | Heaped Capacity (CY) | Payload (tons) | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10-wheel dump truck | 8-10 | 10-12 | 14-16 | Urban/suburban work, road hauling, tight sites |
| Tandem axle dump | 12-14 | 14-16 | 22-26 | General earthwork, road legal, most common |
| Tri-axle dump | 14-16 | 16-18 | 26-30 | Heavier earthwork, road legal in most states |
| Transfer/double trailer | 18-20 | 20-24 | 30-36 | Long haul distances, highway legal, high volume |
| End dump (semi) | 16-18 | 18-22 | 26-30 | Long haul, export/import material, highway legal |
| Belly dump (semi) | 18-20 | 20-24 | 28-32 | Windrow placement, base course, long haul, cannot dump at a specific spot |
| Articulated off-road (25T) | 13-15 | 15-18 | 25 | Soft ground, steep grades, off-road only |
| Articulated off-road (30T) | 16-18 | 18-21 | 30 | Soft ground, steep grades, off-road only |
| Articulated off-road (40T) | 20-23 | 23-25 | 40 | Large earthwork, off-road, mine-type operations |

**Weight vs. Volume Limiting**
Trucks may hit their weight limit before they are visually full, or hit their volume limit before reaching max weight. Check both.
- Loose soil at ~2,800 lb/LCY: a 14-CY tandem carries 14 x 2,800 = 39,200 lb = 19.6 tons (under 22-ton limit, volume-limited)
- Wet clay at ~3,500 lb/LCY: a 14-CY tandem carries 14 x 3,500 = 49,000 lb = 24.5 tons (may exceed 22-ton limit, weight-limited)
- Blasted rock at ~2,600 lb/LCY but with high swell: usually volume-limited

**Rule**: Always calculate both weight and volume. Use the smaller number. On road-legal routes, verify against axle weight limits for the jurisdiction.

### Truck Cycle Time Calculation

The total cycle time for one truck is the sum of five components:

```
Truck Cycle Time = Load Time + Haul Time + Dump Time + Return Time + Spot Time
```

**Load Time**
Load time = Truck capacity (LCY) / Loading equipment production rate (LCY/min)

To convert hourly excavator production to per-minute:
- LCY/min = LCY/hr / 60

Example: Excavator producing 180 LCY/hr = 3.0 LCY/min. Loading a 14-CY truck: 14 / 3.0 = 4.7 minutes.

**Haul Time (Loaded)**
Haul time = Haul distance / Average loaded speed

Typical loaded speeds by road condition:
| Road Condition | Loaded Speed (mph) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Paved highway | 30-45 | Legal speed, traffic dependent |
| Well-maintained haul road | 20-30 | Graded, watered, firm surface |
| Average haul road | 15-20 | Some ruts, dust, moderate grade |
| Poor haul road | 8-15 | Rough, steep, soft spots |
| Off-road (no haul road) | 5-10 | Articulated trucks only |

**Dump Time**
| Dump Method | Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| End dump (free dump) | 1.0-1.5 min | Raise bed, dump, lower bed |
| End dump (spread by dozer) | 1.5-2.0 min | Dump and wait for dozer to clear |
| Belly dump (moving) | 0.5-1.0 min | Open gates while rolling, fastest method |
| Belly dump (stopped) | 0.5-1.0 min | Stop, open gates, pull forward |
| Transfer dump | 1.5-2.5 min | Transfer trailer dumps separately |

**Return Time (Empty)**
Return time = Haul distance / Average empty speed

Empty trucks travel faster: typically 20-30 mph on haul roads, 35-50 mph on highways.

**Spot Time**
Spot time is the time for a truck to maneuver into loading position after arriving at the excavator.
- Good site layout, experienced drivers: 0.5 min
- Average conditions: 0.75-1.0 min
- Congested site, inexperienced drivers, tight quarters: 1.0-1.5 min
- Spotting with a spotter/banksman for blind-side backing: add 0.5 min

### Fleet Balancing: How Many Trucks?

**The Formula**

```
Number of Trucks = Truck Cycle Time / Load Time
```

Round UP to the next whole number. It is better to have one extra truck than to leave the excavator waiting.

**Complete Worked Example**

Situation: 35-ton excavator producing 180 LCY/hr loading 14-CY tandem dump trucks. One-way haul distance is 2 miles on a maintained haul road. Dump at a fill site with dozer spreading.

Step 1 -- Load Time:
- Excavator rate: 180 LCY/hr / 60 = 3.0 LCY/min
- Load time: 14 CY / 3.0 LCY/min = 4.7 min

Step 2 -- Haul Time (Loaded):
- Distance: 2 miles at 20 mph average
- Haul time: (2 / 20) x 60 = 6.0 min

Step 3 -- Dump Time:
- End dump with dozer spread: 1.75 min

Step 4 -- Return Time (Empty):
- Distance: 2 miles at 28 mph average
- Return time: (2 / 28) x 60 = 4.3 min

Step 5 -- Spot Time:
- Average conditions: 0.75 min

Step 6 -- Total Truck Cycle Time:
- 4.7 + 6.0 + 1.75 + 4.3 + 0.75 = 17.5 min

Step 7 -- Number of Trucks:
- 17.5 / 4.7 = 3.7 --> round up to 4 trucks

Step 8 -- Verify Fleet Production:
- With 4 trucks, excavator loads a truck every 4.7 min
- Trucks per hour: 60 / 4.7 = 12.8 loads
- Dirt moved per hour: 12.8 x 14 CY = 179 LCY/hr (excavator is fully utilized)

**Under-Trucked vs. Over-Trucked**

| Situation | What Happens | Cost Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Under-trucked | Excavator sits idle between loads | Very expensive: you pay for idle excavator time ($250-400/hr) |
| Perfectly matched | Excavator and trucks run continuously | Maximum efficiency, hard to maintain all day |
| 1 truck over | Small truck queue, absorbs minor delays | Best practical target: small insurance buffer |
| 2+ trucks over | Significant truck idle time | Wasteful: each idle truck costs $85-150/hr |

**Field Decision**: Aim for 1 truck more than calculated. If one truck breaks down, has a flat tire, or gets stuck at the dump site, you still have enough trucks to keep the excavator running. An idle $350/hr excavator is more expensive than an idle $100/hr truck.

### Distance-Based Equipment Selection

When to switch from one hauling method to another based on one-way haul distance:

| One-Way Distance | Preferred Method | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 0-200 ft | Loader carry | Loader can load and haul in one operation |
| 0-300 ft | Dozer push | No loading or hauling equipment needed |
| 200-1,500 ft | Excavator + on-site trucks | Short cycle, high production |
| 500-5,000 ft | Scraper (self-loading or push-loaded) | Loads while moving, no separate trucks needed |
| 1,500 ft - 5 miles | Excavator + road dump trucks | Standard earthwork setup |
| 5+ miles | Excavator + transfer/semi trucks | Larger payloads justify longer haul |

### Scraper Operations

Scrapers are self-loading, hauling, and dumping machines. They beat excavator-and-truck combinations in specific conditions.

**When Scrapers Win**
- Haul distance 500-5,000 ft (the sweet spot)
- Large open sites with good haul roads
- Material is self-loading (sandy soil, loose earth) or push-loading with a dozer is feasible
- Thin-lift spreading is needed (scrapers spread as they dump)
- Cut-to-fill operations on the same site

**When Scrapers Lose**
- Haul distance under 500 ft (loader or dozer is cheaper)
- Haul distance over 5,000 ft (trucks are cheaper per CY-mile)
- Rocky or hard material that will not self-load
- Steep grades on haul road (scrapers are slow on grades)
- Wet, muddy conditions (scrapers get stuck easily)
- Urban or confined sites (scrapers need wide turns)

**Scraper Types and Capacity**

| Type | Capacity (CY struck) | Capacity (CY heaped) | Best Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single engine, self-loading | 10-15 | 12-18 | Short haul, self-loading in easy material |
| Twin engine (tandem powered) | 15-25 | 18-30 | Longer haul, better grade climbing |
| Elevating | 12-18 | 15-22 | Self-loading without pusher, moderate haul |
| Push-pull (pair working together) | 15-25 each | 18-30 each | Two scrapers alternate pushing each other to load |

**Push-Loading Production**
A push-loaded scraper needs a dozer pusher. One D8 or D9 dozer can push-load a scraper in 30-60 seconds. The pusher can typically serve 4-6 scrapers depending on haul distance:
- Short haul (<1,000 ft): pusher can serve 3-4 scrapers
- Medium haul (1,000-3,000 ft): pusher can serve 5-6 scrapers
- Long haul (>3,000 ft): pusher can serve 6-8 scrapers

**Breakeven Analysis: Scraper vs. Excavator + Trucks**
For a typical job moving 20,000+ CY:
- Under 1,500 ft one-way: excavator + trucks usually wins (faster cycle)
- 1,500-2,000 ft: breakeven zone, depends on material and site
- Over 2,000 ft one-way: scrapers often win on cost per CY (fewer operators, no separate loading equipment)
- Over 5,000 ft: trucks regain advantage (scrapers are slow haulers)

## EQUIPMENT MATCHING DECISION TABLES

These are the quick-reference tables for field decisions. When someone asks "what do I need?", start here and then fine-tune with the production rate tables above.

### Earthmoving Equipment Selection by Job Size

| Job Size (CY) | Category | Equipment Combination | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| <100 | Very Small | Mini excavator + 1-2 small dump trucks, or skid steer | Residential work, utility trenching |
| 100-500 | Small | Mini/small excavator (6-15T) + 2-3 dump trucks, or skid steer + small dump | Small site work, landscaping, small foundations |
| 500-2,000 | Medium-Small | Standard excavator (20-30T) + 3-4 tandem dumps | Typical commercial site prep, underground utility |
| 2,000-5,000 | Medium | Standard excavator (30T) + 4-5 tandem dumps, or D5/D6 dozer for short push (<300 ft) | Commercial pads, parking lots, subdivision grading |
| 5,000-20,000 | Medium-Large | Large excavator (35-50T) + 5-7 trucks, or scraper fleet (4-6 scrapers + pusher) | Large commercial, small highway jobs |
| 20,000-50,000 | Large | Large excavator + 6-8 off-road artics, or scraper fleet (6-8 scrapers + 2 pushers), or dozer fleet for mass push | Highway construction, large subdivision mass grading |
| >50,000 | Very Large | Multiple large excavators + articulated truck fleets, or large scraper fleet, or combination of all methods | Major highway, dam construction, mine development |

**Key Consideration**: These are starting points. Actual equipment selection depends on material type, haul distance, site access, available fleet, and schedule constraints. A 5,000 CY job that is all short-push (<200 ft) may use only a dozer. The same 5,000 CY job with a 3-mile export haul needs excavator and highway trucks.

### Grading Equipment Selection by Tolerance

| Task | Equipment | Achievable Tolerance | Typical Application |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mass earthwork/rough cut | D6-D8 dozer, no GPS | +/- 0.3 ft (3.6 in) | Bulk cut/fill, rough subgrade, clearing |
| Rough grade (improved) | D4-D6 dozer with GPS/machine control | +/- 0.1 ft (1.2 in) | Subgrade preparation, pad grading, ditch shaping |
| Intermediate grade | Motor grader, no GPS | +/- 0.05-0.10 ft (0.6-1.2 in) | Road subgrade, base course, parking lot subgrade |
| Fine grade | Motor grader with GPS/machine control | +/- 0.02-0.04 ft (0.25-0.5 in) | Finished subgrade, aggregate base, curb line |
| Precision grade | Laser-guided screed or grading box | +/- 0.01 ft (0.12 in) | Concrete flatwork subgrade, athletic fields, airport runways |
| Ultra-precision | String line and hand work | +/- 0.005 ft (0.06 in) | Curb and gutter flow line, critical drainage channels |

**GPS/Machine Control Advantage**
- Reduces staking costs (fewer survey stakes needed, or none)
- Reduces over-excavation by 15-30% (material savings pay for the system)
- Allows grading in poor visibility (dust, fog, darkness)
- Operator sees real-time cut/fill on in-cab display
- Requires initial survey model upload; verify model matches plan before starting

### Pipe Trench Equipment Selection

| Pipe Diameter | Trench Width (min) | Excavator Class | Bucket Width | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4-8 in | 24-30 in | Mini (3-6T) | 18-24 in | Residential service laterals |
| 8-12 in | 30-36 in | Small (6-10T) | 24-30 in | Residential/commercial water, sewer laterals |
| 12-18 in | 36-42 in | Small-Medium (10-15T) | 30-36 in | Commercial mains, small storm |
| 18-24 in | 42-48 in | Medium (15-25T) | 36-42 in | Sewer mains, storm drains |
| 24-36 in | 48-60 in | Medium-Large (25-35T) | 42-48 in | Large storm, trunk sewer |
| 36-48 in | 60-72 in | Large (35-50T) | 48-60 in | Major trunk lines, outfalls |
| >48 in | 72+ in | Large (50T+) or open cut | 60+ in | Major infrastructure, may require sheeting/shoring design |

### Demolition Equipment Selection

| Structure Type | Equipment | Attachment | Production Rate (approx) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wood frame residential | 20-25T excavator | Thumb/grapple | 1 house per 4-8 hours |
| Wood frame commercial | 30-40T excavator | Thumb/grapple | Varies with size, 1-3 days |
| Concrete slab on grade | 25-35T excavator | Hydraulic breaker | 500-1,000 SF/hr for 4-6 in slab |
| Concrete walls (8-12 in) | 30-45T excavator | Hydraulic breaker or processor | 50-100 LF/hr depending on rebar |
| Steel structure | 30-50T excavator | Shear or processor | Highly variable, plan per member |
| Asphalt pavement (3-4 in) | Milling machine or excavator | Cold mill or ripper tooth | 3,000-8,000 SY/day (mill), slower by excavator |
| Concrete pavement (6-8 in) | Excavator + breaker, or drop ball | Hydraulic breaker | 200-500 SY/day |
| Interior selective demo | Mini excavator (2-4T) or hand labor | Thumb, grapple, or hand tools | Highly variable, plan per room/floor |

**Demolition Sequencing Rule**: Always work top-down and outside-in. Never undercut a structure. Remove hazardous materials (asbestos, lead paint, PCBs) before mechanical demolition begins. Verify utility disconnects before any demolition activity.
