## Superintendent's Reference — Real Tolerances and Installation Standards

---

## 1. HIGH-STRENGTH BOLT REFERENCE

### Bolt Grade Summary
| Grade | Designation | Tensile Strength | Primary Use |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| A325 | 120 ksi | 120 ksi | General structural connections, most common grade |
| A490 | 150 ksi | 150 ksi | Heavy connections, moment frames, high-load applications |

### Torque Requirements — CRITICAL NOTE
**RCSC Standard does NOT specify standard torque values.** Torque must be determined through pre-installation verification testing using the actual bolt lot received. Never use generic torque tables alone.

**Pre-Installation Verification Testing (Required):**
1. Use minimum 3 bolts from the job lot
2. Install in test coupons matching job connection geometry (thickness, number of plies)
3. Tighten per planned method (Turn-of-Nut, TC, Calibrated Wrench)
4. Measure installed tension using calibrated tension indicator (e.g., ultrasonic bolt indicator, load cell)
5. Document relationship between tightening method (turns/wrench setting) and achieved tension
6. Establish job-specific tightening procedure

### Typical Torque Reference by Diameter (A325 and A490)
**For reference only — MUST be verified with pre-installation testing:**

| Diameter | A325 (ft-lbs) | A490 (ft-lbs) | Grip Range (inches) |
|----------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| 5/8" | 95-105 | 140-155 | 1-2" typical |
| 3/4" | 135-150 | 200-225 | 1-3" typical |
| 7/8" | 200-220 | 295-330 | 1.5-4" typical |
| 1" | 270-300 | 400-450 | 2-5" typical |
| 1-1/8" | 360-400 | 535-595 | 2-6" typical |
| 1-1/4" | 480-530 | 710-800 | 2.5-7" typical |
| 1-3/8" | 630-700 | 930-1045 | 3-8" typical |
| 1-1/2" | 810-900 | 1195-1345 | 3-9" typical |

**Note:** These are reference values only. Job specifications and pre-installation verification testing establish final torque parameters.

### Snug-Tight Definition (AISC)
**Firmness attained with:**
- A few impacts of an impact wrench, OR
- Full effort with a spud wrench

**Visual confirmation:** Plies are drawn into firm contact; no gaps visible between connected members. Do not over-tighten snug-tight connections.

---

## 2. INSTALLATION METHODS

### Turn-of-Nut Method
**Process:**
1. **Snug-Tight:** Bring plies into firm contact using impact wrench or spud wrench
2. **Measure turn:** Identify initial bolt head position (mark with chalk/paint)
3. **Apply specified turn:** Rotate nut the required number of turns from snug-tight position
4. **Turn rate varies by bolt length and grip:**

| Bolt Length (inches) | Grip ≤ 4" | Grip 4-8" | Grip 8-12" |
|---------------------|---------|---------|----------|
| ≤ 2" over grip | 1/3 turn | 1/2 turn | 2/3 turn |
| 2-6" over grip | 1/2 turn | 2/3 turn | 3/4 turn |
| > 6" over grip | 2/3 turn | 3/4 turn | 1 turn |

**Quality control:**
- Verify snug-tight baseline before applying turn
- Use calibrated impact wrench or torque wrench for turn application
- Document torque/turn for each connection
- Spot-check with tension indicator on completed connections

### Tension Control (TC) Bolts
**Method:**
1. Insert bolt through holes with spline shank and load-indicating fastener
2. Tighten with impact wrench at controlled speed until spline tip shears off
3. Broken spline tip = bolt at predetermined tension (no further tightening required)

**Advantages:**
- Faster installation than Turn-of-Nut
- Less field measurement/verification required
- Each bolt audibly/visibly confirms proper tension

**Field check:**
- Verify spline has cleanly sheared (not broken mid-shank)
- Check sheared piece is visible in wrench (not lost/dropped)

### Calibrated Wrench Method
**Setup (1 per job):**
1. Select representative bolts from lot
2. Install in test coupons matching job conditions
3. Install first bolt, measure tension with calibrated indicator
4. Install subsequent bolts, increasing wrench torque until tension matches first bolt
5. Document wrench torque setting (e.g., "set to 450 ft-lbs for 1" A325 bolts")

**Field installation:**
1. Pre-calibrate wrench to established setting
2. Tighten each bolt to wrench setting
3. Spot-check with tension indicator (minimum every 20 bolts)

### Snug-Tight Only (No Pretensioning)
**When used:**
- Bearing-type shear connections (most common)
- Shear connections in non-seismic frames
- Bracing connections (pin-ended, not moment-resisting)
- Per AISC, when moment transfer not required

**Installation:**
- Tighten to snug-tight (plies in firm contact)
- No further tightening required
- Fastest installation method

**Field verification:** Visual confirmation that plies are drawn together with no visible gaps.

## 3. ERECTION TOLERANCES (AISC Code of Standard Practice)

### Column Plumb
- **Tolerance:** ±1:500 (1 inch per 500 inches of height)
- **Maximum:** 2 inches for buildings ≤20 stories
- **Measurement:** Plumb bob or transit from top to base
- **Critical:** Check before bolting to permanent connections; correction becomes difficult after bolting

### Column Elevation (Base Plate)
- **Tolerance:** ±1/8" from theoretical elevation
- **Measurement:** Elevation of top of base plate relative to concrete top surface
- **Check:** Before bolting column to anchor bolts
- **Correction:** Shim pack under base plate (stainless or mild steel shims, ≤1/8" per shim)

### Beam Elevation at Connections
- **Tolerance:** ±3/16" from theoretical elevation
- **Measurement:** At beam end connections (critical for bearing on column or existing beam)
- **Common issue:** Deck camber may lower beam elevation; anticipate and verify with erection drawing

### Beam Sweep
- **Tolerance:** L/1000 maximum lateral deviation (L = member length)
- **Example:** 40-foot beam = 40/1000 = 0.48" max sweep
- **Visual check:** Sight along beam from end; minor bow is acceptable if within tolerance
- **Measurement:** String line or laser along beam length

### Column Splice Alignment
- **Tolerance:** ±1/4" from working line (centerline)
- **Measurement:** Horizontal offset measured perpendicular to working line
- **Critical:** Flange plates and web plates must align; misalignment causes high local stresses
- **Correction:** Shims in splice plates if required

### Anchor Bolt Location
- **Tolerance:** ±1/4" from theoretical center in plan view
- **Measurement:** Plan view distance from anchor bolt center to theoretical location
- **Verification:** After concrete strip-out, before setting column
- **Out-of-tolerance resolution:** Field drilling may be feasible for minor variations; check with structural engineer

### Anchor Bolt Projection
- **Tolerance:** -0 / +1/2" above concrete
- **Meaning:** Bolts must NOT be below finish concrete; up to 1/2" above is acceptable
- **Field check:** Measure bolt top relative to concrete finish before column setting
- **Low projection issue:** Add washer and nut extensions if necessary (verify with EOR)

## 4. CONNECTION TYPES — FIELD RECOGNITION

### Shear Connections (Simple Connections)
**Function:** Transfer vertical load only; beam end rotates freely under load

**Visual identification:**
- Single shear tab (welded to column flange or web, bolted to beam web)
- Double angle connection (angles bolted to column and beam web)
- End plate connection with few bolts (typically 2-4 per connection)

**Field installation:**
1. Align beam on connection (shear tab or angles carry vertical load)
2. Check beam is roughly level (within erection tolerance)
3. Install all bolts, snug-tight
4. No moment transfer or high-tension bolting required

**Common locations:** Most beam-to-column connections in non-seismic buildings

### Moment Connections (Rigid Connections)
**Function:** Transfer both shear AND moment; maintains beam-column rigidity

**Visual identification:**
- Welded flange plates (top and bottom flanges welded to column)
- Directly welded beam flanges to column (no plates)
- Extended end plate with many bolts (typically 6-16 per connection)
- Thick end plates (≥1/2" often visible)

**Field installation:**
1. Align beam precisely (elevation tolerance ±3/16")
2. Fit-up bolts first (temporary bolts, not full tension)
3. Verify alignment and connection geometry before welding or high-tension bolting
4. If bolted: tighten to specified pretension (Turn-of-Nut or Calibrated Wrench, not snug-tight)
5. If welded: perform welds per welding procedure; inspect per plan

**Critical:** Moment connections require accurate alignment and proper installation; they affect overall frame stability

**Common locations:** Seismic frames, moment-resisting frames, rigid portals

### Splice Connections (Member-to-Member Splices)
**Function:** Join members that cannot be shipped in one piece

**Types:**
- **Column splice:** Flange plates bolted/welded to both upper and lower column pieces
- **Beam splice:** Similar to column splice; web and flange plates
- **Web-only splice:** When only web splicing is required (rare)

**Field installation:**
1. Position lower and upper pieces in alignment
2. Install splice plates
3. Temporary bolts/clamps may hold pieces in position during final bolting/welding
4. Tighten all bolts to specified tension or weld per procedure
5. Alignment: column splices must not cause vertical/horizontal offset (tolerance ±1/4")

**Inspection:** Visual and ultrasonic per plan; typical for critical splices

### Bracing Connections (Gusset Plate Connections)
**Function:** Transfer axial forces from bracing members (tension and compression)

**Visual identification:**
- Gusset plate welded or bolted to beam and column at brace-to-frame joint
- Brace bolted/welded to gusset (eccentric loading is common)
- Multiple bolts or welds around perimeter of gusset

**Field installation:**
1. Verify gusset plate orientation matches drawing
2. Check brace member length and end fit
3. Install bolts or welds per specification
4. For bolted: tighten to snug-tight or specified pretension per plan

**Critical:** Gusset connections often eccentric; alignment matters for load transfer

## 5. WELD INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS

### Visual Inspection (VT) — ALWAYS Required
**Performed by:** Qualified Inspector (QCI) or designated QA personnel

**What is inspected:**
- Weld bead profile (size, consistency, surface condition)
- Surface cracks (visible to naked eye)
- Undercut, overlap, spatter
- Weld size matches drawing specification
- Access/cleanliness adequate for welding process

**When:** On every joint after welding; before proceeding to next weld

**Pass/fail:** Surface appearance; no visible cracks allowed. Minor spatter and undercut may be acceptable per AWS D1.1

### Ultrasonic Testing (UT) — Typical for CJP Welds
**Performed by:** UT Level II technician with weld-specific certification

**Percentage of joints typically tested:**
- **Standard CJP welds:** 10-25% of welds
- **Demand-critical welds (seismic, special moment frames):** 100% of critical welds
- **PJP welds:** 5-10% (lower rate than CJP)

**What is detected:** Internal defects (porosity, lack of fusion, inclusions, cracks)

**Equipment:** Portable ultrasonic flaw detector with calibrated transducer

**When:** After welding complete and visual inspection passed

**Results:** Acceptance or rejection per AWS D1.1 or project-specific acceptance criteria

### Magnetic Particle (MT) — Surface Crack Detection
**Performed by:** MT Level II technician

**When used:** On completed welds, especially high-carbon steels or heavily restrained joints prone to cracking

**What is detected:** Surface and near-surface cracks (excellent surface sensitivity)

**Percentage:** Project-specific; often combined with UT on critical welds (10-15% of welds)

**Equipment:** Portable magnetic particle unit with wet or dry particles

**Timing:** After welding and stress relief (if required)

### Radiographic Testing (RT) — Internal Defect Detection
**Performed by:** RT Level II technician; requires radiation safety license

**Primary use:** Pressure vessels, piping; less common in structural steel

**Percentage for structural:** Rare; used only for special demand-critical welds or when specified

**What is detected:** Internal voids, inclusions, lack of fusion (good internal visibility)

**Disadvantages:** Slower, more expensive, requires radiation safety compliance

### CJP (Complete Joint Penetration) Welds
**Definition:** Weld fully penetrates the joint; no unbonded area in the joint

**Visual indicators:**
- Full bead on both sides of joint (web, flanges)
- Consistent weld size through depth
- Root pass visible on back side if accessible

**Inspection rate:** Higher (typically 10-25% UT)

**Critical locations:** Column splices, beam-to-column moment connections, critical moment connections

### PJP (Partial Joint Penetration) Welds
**Definition:** Weld intentionally does not fully penetrate joint (design-specific)

**Visual indicators:**
- Root opening remains visible (no weld at deepest part of joint)
- Weld depth specified on drawing (e.g., "PJP, 3/4" depth")

**Inspection rate:** Lower (typically 5-10% UT)

**Common use:** Shear tabs, end plates where bearing transfers vertical load

**Critical:** Do NOT over-weld a PJP; verify depth with drawing before welding

### Fillet Welds
**Definition:** Partial penetration welds in corner or lap joint; L-shaped cross-section

**Visual inspection:**
- Consistent fillet size across length
- No excessive undercut at toe
- Weld appears to merge smoothly with base metal

**Testing:** Primarily visual unless specified otherwise

**Measurement:** Fillet size (leg) measured with fillet weld gauge; record on inspection report

## 6. PIECE MARK TRACKING

### Piece Mark System
**Definition:** Unique identifier assigned by fabricator to every steel member

**Format (typical):**
- Building designation + member type + sequence number
- Example: "B-1-C1" = Building 1, Column 1
- Example: "B-1-B42" = Building 1, Beam 42

**Location on member:** Stamped or stenciled on flange or web, usually near one end

### Erection Drawing Cross-Reference
**On framing plan:** Piece marks identify member locations
- Plan shows grid layout with piece marks labeled
- Elevation drawings show splices and connection details by piece mark
- Section views tie piece marks to specific splice locations

### Field Verification Procedure
1. **Delivery:** Receive shipment with packing list organized by piece mark
2. **Unload and sort:** Place members in erection sequence order
3. **Mark off:** As each piece is erected, check it off the packing list
4. **Verify orientation:** Confirm member orientation (rolled direction, camber direction, bolt hole positions) matches drawing
5. **Document:** Maintain daily erection log with piece marks and installation sequence

### Common Issues
- **Piece missing:** Check packing list against shipment; notify fabricator immediately
- **Piece damaged:** Assess damage; determine if field repair is feasible (notify EOR) or replacement required
- **Piece wrong location:** Cross-check piece mark against drawing before installation
- **Rotated member:** Some members (certain beams, bracing) can be installed rotated; verify with drawing or EOR before proceeding

### Coordination with Shipping
- **Erection sequence:** Fabricator typically ships in erection order (ground floor to top)
- **Delivery timing:** Coordinate with superintendent to avoid site congestion
- **Holding area:** Designate storage area for members awaiting erection, organized by piece mark

## 7. STEEL ERECTION SAFETY (OSHA 1926 Subpart R)

### Pre-Erection Conference — Required
**Participants:** General Contractor, Structural Steel Contractor, Site Superintendent, Safety Manager, Connector Crew Lead

**Topics addressed:**
- Anchor bolt verification and condition
- Column stabilization procedure
- Decking installation sequence
- Fall protection plan and controlled decking zone (CDZ)
- Communication signals (hand signals, two-way radio)
- Weather conditions and wind speed limits
- Emergency procedures

### Column Anchor Bolts
**Minimum requirement:** 4 anchor bolts per column (OSHA 1926.755)

**Project-specific design:** Verify with structural drawings; some columns may require more bolts

**Field inspection before column setting:**
1. Visually inspect bolts for damage or corrosion
2. Verify projection above concrete: -0 / +1/2" per AISC tolerance
3. Check location within ±1/4" of theoretical center
4. Ensure all bolts are clean and free of concrete/dirt

**Corrective action:** If bolts low, add washers and nuts to extend projection (verify with EOR)

### Fall Protection — 100% Tie-Off Above 15 Feet
**Requirement:** Workers above 15 feet on steel must be 100% tied-off at all times

**Anchor points:**
- Approved connector horizontal lifeline
- Structural members (with approval)
- Mobile safety systems

**Equipment:** ANSI Z359.14-compliant harness, lanyard, shock absorber

**Responsibility:** Fall protection provided by structural steel contractor; general contractor verifies compliance

### Controlled Decking Zone (CDZ)
**Definition:** Area where initial decking is being installed, with elevated fall hazard

**Limitations:**
- Maximum 90 feet from leading edge (measured horizontally)
- Maximum 3,000 square feet area
- Only trained personnel in CDZ
- Perimeter marked with warning lines, signs, or barriers

**Exemption:** Workers 100% tied-off or wearing approved hard hats that meet ANSI Z89.1 Type I with chin straps (not common; most rely on tie-off)

**Duration:** Until decking is fully installed and sheathed, or alternate fall protection installed

### Column Splices — Temporary Load Transfer
**Minimum bolts before releasing crane load:** 2 bolts per flange (minimum)

**Meaning:** Do NOT release column load to structure until at least 2 bolts per flange are installed and tightened (snug-tight minimum)

**Typical procedure:**
1. Set upper column piece
2. Install first bolts in both flanges (minimum 2 per side)
3. Tighten snug-tight
4. Only then release crane load and proceed to web bolts and final tightening

**Web bolts:** May be installed after column is safely supported; not required for load transfer

### Beams — Temporary Bolting Before Release
**Minimum bolts before releasing crane load:** 2 bolts per connection (minimum)

**Meaning:** Install and tighten at least 2 bolts at each beam connection before releasing crane load

**Typical procedure:**
1. Set beam on connection (shear tab, angles, or bolted end plate)
2. Install first bolts (minimum 2)
3. Tighten snug-tight
4. Only then release crane load
5. Install remaining bolts

**Wrench-tight requirement:** OSHA states bolts must be wrench-tight (snug-tight) before load release; final pretensioning may occur later

## Quick Reference: Common Field Scenarios

### Scenario: Column setting and temporary stability
1. Verify anchor bolts (projection, location, cleanliness)
2. Check column base plate elevation (±1/8")
3. Install initial bolts and tighten snug-tight
4. Install temporary bracing per erection plan
5. Verify column plumb (±1:500, max 2")
6. Do not release crane until bracing confirmed in place

### Scenario: Bolted moment connection installation
1. Install fit-up bolts (temporary, hand-tight)
2. Verify beam elevation (±3/16") and alignment
3. Check connection geometry matches drawing
4. Once aligned: tighten all bolts to snug-tight
5. Apply specified pretension (Turn-of-Nut or Calibrated Wrench)
6. Document torque/turn for inspection

### Scenario: Weld inspection coordination
1. Visual inspection by QCI on every joint (before any other testing)
2. Surface defects noted; EOR approval required for rework or rejection
3. UT sampling per plan (10-25% typical); results reported same day
4. Any defects found: EOR determines acceptance, repair method, or rejection
5. Maintain inspection report; do not proceed to next stage without clearance

### Scenario: Damaged member discovered during erection
1. Stop work; do not install damaged member
2. Photograph damage; notify fabricator and EOR immediately
3. EOR determines if repair is feasible in field or member must be replaced
4. If field repair approved: document method and inspection requirements
5. If replacement: coordinate with fabricator and schedule delivery

## Field Reference Reminders

- **Always verify erection drawing before installation** — do not rely on memory or previous similar projects
- **Bolt pretensioning is not optional in seismic or moment-resisting frames** — verify method and calibration before starting
- **Tolerances are tight** — column plumb and beam elevation require measurement, not visual estimation
- **Piece marks are your blueprint in the field** — keep packing list organized and cross-check every member
- **Safety is non-negotiable** — fall protection and temporary bolting are legal requirements, not recommendations
- **Communication with fabricator and EOR is essential** — damaged members, design questions, and field conditions require immediate notification
