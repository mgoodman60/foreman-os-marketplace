## 1. SCAFFOLD TYPES COMPARISON

| Type | Best For | Load Capacity | Relative Cost | Assembly Speed | Key Advantage |
|------|----------|---------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Frame (Sectional)** | General access, masonry, painting | Light to Heavy duty | Low | Fast | Most common, economical, simple to erect |
| **System/Modular (Ringlock, Cuplock)** | Complex geometry, high-rise, industrial | Light to Heavy duty | Medium-High | Fast | Versatile configuration, fewer loose parts |
| **Tube-and-Clamp (Tube-and-Coupler)** | Irregular shapes, bridges, around obstacles | Light to Heavy duty | Medium | Slow | Fully adjustable, fits any geometry |
| **Mast Climbing (Work Platform)** | High-rise exterior, curtain wall, EIFS | Medium duty (50 PSF typical) | High (rental) | N/A (motorized) | Moves vertically on mast — no full scaffold |
| **Suspended/Swing Stage** | Facade work, window installation, caulking | Light to Medium duty | Medium (rental) | Fast | Access from roof, no ground obstruction |
| **Rolling/Mobile** | Interior painting, MEP trim, ceilings | Light to Medium duty | Low | Very Fast | Relocates easily, no tie-ins needed |
| **Cantilever/Needle Beam** | Over obstructions, loading docks | Medium duty | Medium | Slow | Extends beyond support structure |

## 2. LOAD CLASSIFICATIONS AND CAPACITY

### OSHA Load Classifications

| Classification | Rated Load (PSF) | Typical Use | Concentrated Load per Platform |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **Light Duty** | 25 PSF | Painting, inspection, light carpentry, caulking | 250 lbs max in 1-foot span |
| **Medium Duty** | 50 PSF | Masonry, plastering, stucco, drywall, MEP | 250 lbs max in 1-foot span |
| **Heavy Duty** | 75 PSF | Concrete work, stone setting, heavy equipment, material staging | 250 lbs max in 1-foot span |

### Capacity Quick Calculator

**Maximum load on a platform = Platform area (SF) x Load rating (PSF)**

| Platform Size | Light (25 PSF) | Medium (50 PSF) | Heavy (75 PSF) |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 5' x 7' (35 SF) | 875 lbs | 1,750 lbs | 2,625 lbs |
| 5' x 10' (50 SF) | 1,250 lbs | 2,500 lbs | 3,750 lbs |
| 7' x 10' (70 SF) | 1,750 lbs | 3,500 lbs | 5,250 lbs |

**Weight Reference for Field Estimates:**
- **Worker with tools:** 300 lbs (per OSHA calculation standard)
- **Mortar board (loaded):** 150-200 lbs
- **Bundle of CMU (6 block):** 180-240 lbs
- **5-gallon bucket of material:** 50-70 lbs
- **Scaffold plank (2x10x16'):** 45-55 lbs
- **Metal scaffold deck (7'x19"):** 30-40 lbs

**Rule of Thumb:** Never load any single platform with more than **workers + materials** that exceeds the rated capacity. When in doubt, calculate it.

## 3. OSHA 1926.450-454 — PRACTICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Foundation and Base (1926.451(c))

- **Firm, level base required** — scaffold on soft or uneven ground is a citation and a collapse risk
- **Mudsills mandatory on soil** — minimum 2x10 continuous lumber under each leg row; sized to prevent settlement
- **Base plates mandatory** on all scaffold legs — distribute load to mudsill or hard surface
- **Screw jacks (leveling jacks):** Use to level scaffold on uneven surfaces — maximum extension per manufacturer (typically 12-18" max)
- **No unstable objects as base** — concrete blocks, bricks, buckets, or scrap lumber under legs is PROHIBITED
- **Grade the area first** if uneven — backfill, compact, and level before setting scaffold

### Bracing (1926.451(c))

- **Cross-bracing per manufacturer specifications** — do NOT omit any brace shown in the erection manual
- **Never remove bracing on an occupied scaffold** — even temporarily
- **Horizontal bracing (ledgers)** at every level where platforms are installed
- **Diagonal bracing** on at least every other bay (or per manufacturer); more bracing = more stable
- **Bracing at base level** is critical — prevents racking and collapse

### Planking and Platforms (1926.451(b))

- **Scaffold-grade lumber** (minimum 1,500 fiber stress) or **manufactured scaffold planks/decks**
- **Extend planks minimum 6" beyond support** — maximum 12" (prevents tipping if stepped on end)
- **No gaps >1" between adjacent planks** — prevents tools/debris falling through
- **No gaps >9.5"** between platform edge and face of structure (for work within reach)
- **Platform width:** Minimum 18" for general use (20" preferred); 20" minimum for masonry
- **Planks must be secured against movement** — cleated, restrained, or hooks on manufactured decks
- **Do NOT use scaffold planks that are split, warped, have excessive knots, or show damage** — remove from service immediately

### Guardrails (1926.451(g))

- **Required on ALL open sides and ends** of platforms more than 10 feet above lower level
- **Top rail height:** 38-45 inches above platform surface (42" is standard practice)
- **Mid-rail:** At approximately mid-point between top rail and platform
- **Toe board:** 3.5" minimum height above platform — prevents tools and materials from falling
- **Guardrail strength:** Top rail must withstand 200 lbs downward or outward force
- **Cross-bracing as guardrail:** ONLY acceptable if the crossing point of the X-brace falls between 38-48" above the platform AND the brace is continuous. Otherwise, separate guardrails required
- **Screen or mesh:** Required below toe board if workers are below and objects could roll off platform

### Access (1926.451(e))

- **Provided when platform height exceeds 2 feet above or below point of access**
- **Acceptable access:** Portable ladder, attached ladder, stair tower, built-in ladder rungs, ramp
- **Climbing cross-braces is PROHIBITED** — this is one of the most common violations
- **Ladder placement:** Extend 3 feet above platform landing; secured against displacement
- **Stair towers:** Required when scaffold is used for high-traffic access (preferred over ladders for efficiency and safety)
- **Access points must not be obstructed** — keep landing areas clear of material storage

### Capacity and Safety Factors

- **Supported scaffolds:** Must support 4x maximum intended load without failure
- **Suspension scaffolds:** Must support 6x intended load on each rope
- **All components must be rated** — no substitution of unrated materials (wire, rope, random lumber)
- **Scaffold must support its own weight + maximum intended load + wind/environmental loads**

---

## 4. COMPETENT PERSON REQUIREMENTS

### Who Qualifies

Per OSHA 1926.450, a **competent person** is one who:
- Can identify existing and predictable hazards in the surroundings or working conditions
- Is authorized to take prompt corrective action to eliminate hazards
- Has training in scaffold erection, use, and inspection per the manufacturer

**In practice:** Typically a scaffold foreman, safety manager, or experienced superintendent with documented scaffold training.

### Competent Person Responsibilities

1. **Select scaffold type and components** appropriate for the task
2. **Direct erection, dismantling, and alteration** of scaffolds
3. **Inspect scaffolds before each work shift** and after any event that could affect structural integrity
4. **Authorize use** — only the competent person places or removes scaffold tags
5. **Train scaffold users** on hazards and proper use
6. **Stop work** if scaffold is unsafe — remove tag and prohibit use until corrected
7. **Determine if conditions are safe** for scaffold use (wind, ice, lightning, etc.)

### Documentation Required

- Competent person's name and qualifications on file
- Training records for all scaffold users
- Daily inspection logs (signed by competent person)
- Any modification or repair documentation
- Tag system log (when tags changed and why)

## 5. SCAFFOLD TAG SYSTEM

### Standard Color Codes

| Tag Color | Meaning | Who Can Work On It | Inspection Status |
|-----------|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **GREEN** | Safe — Inspected and approved for use | All authorized workers | Current inspection by competent person |
| **YELLOW** | Caution — Specific restrictions apply | Only workers aware of specific restrictions | Modified use authorized by competent person |
| **RED** | DANGER — Do NOT use | NO ONE except erection/dismantling crew | Under construction, modification, or failed inspection |

### Tag Content Requirements

Every scaffold tag must include:
- **Date of inspection**
- **Competent person name and signature**
- **Load capacity (light/medium/heavy duty)**
- **Restrictions (Yellow tag):** Specific limitations (e.g., "Use Level 1-3 only," "No material storage above Level 2")
- **Tag must be visible at each access point**

### When to Change Tags

- **Green to Yellow:** Damage found but scaffold is partially usable; modification in progress on section
- **Green to Red:** Failed inspection, structural damage, weather damage, modification required
- **Red to Green:** Repairs complete, reinspected by competent person, approved for use
- **Any tag change** must be documented with date, reason, and competent person signature

## 6. ERECTION SEQUENCE

### Standard Frame Scaffold Erection

1. **Layout and planning**
   - Review erection drawings and manufacturer instructions
   - Confirm scaffold type, height, load class, and tie-in locations
   - Mark layout on ground — check for overhead power lines (minimum 10 feet clearance for <50kV)
   - Identify underground utilities before placing base

2. **Base preparation**
   - Grade and compact soil (or verify hard surface)
   - Place mudsills — continuous 2x10 minimum, level within 1/4" per 10 feet
   - Set base plates on mudsills — center on sill, plumb

3. **First lift (frames and cross-braces)**
   - Set first pair of end frames on base plates
   - Install cross-braces between frames — pin or lock all connections
   - Level first frames within 1/4" using screw jacks
   - Check plumb in both directions

4. **Build up — additional lifts**
   - Stack frames, inserting coupling pins (gravity locks or spring clips)
   - Install cross-braces at each level
   - Check plumb and level every 2 lifts minimum
   - Install horizontal ledgers/bearers at platform levels

5. **Platforms**
   - Install planks or manufactured decks at working levels
   - Ensure 6-12" overhang, no gaps >1"
   - Secure planks against displacement

6. **Guardrails**
   - Install top rail, mid-rail, and toe boards at all platform levels
   - Cross-bracing may serve as guardrail ONLY if it meets height requirements

7. **Access**
   - Install ladder, stair tower, or built-in access at designated points
   - Secure ladders — extend 3 feet above landing

8. **Tie-ins**
   - Install ties at required intervals (see Section 9)
   - Verify tie-in connection to structure is adequate

9. **Inspection and tagging**
   - Competent person final inspection — check all connections, bracing, planking, guardrails
   - Attach GREEN tag at each access point
   - Document inspection in scaffold log

## 8. SCAFFOLD INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS

### Pre-Shift Inspection (Daily — Before Each Shift)

**Performed by:** Competent person (visual walk-around, 5-10 minutes)

- [ ] Scaffold tag is GREEN and current
- [ ] Base plates seated on mudsills, no settlement or shifting
- [ ] All frames plumb (visual check — use level if questionable)
- [ ] Cross-braces in place, pins/locks engaged
- [ ] Platforms complete — no missing planks, no gaps >1"
- [ ] Guardrails intact — top rail, mid-rail, toe boards
- [ ] Access ladders or stairs in place and secured
- [ ] Tie-ins connected and tight
- [ ] No ice, snow, debris, or slippery conditions on platforms
- [ ] No damage from overnight (weather, vehicle contact, material impact)
- [ ] No unauthorized modifications (missing braces, extra loads, altered access)

### Weekly Documented Inspection

**Performed by:** Competent person (thorough inspection with documentation)

All items from pre-shift inspection PLUS:
- [ ] Check all coupling pins and locking devices for wear or damage
- [ ] Inspect planks for cracks, splits, warping, excessive wear
- [ ] Verify guardrail post connections are tight
- [ ] Measure plumb/level — 1/4" per 10 feet tolerance
- [ ] Check tie-in connections and verify structural attachment is sound
- [ ] Inspect base condition — any new settlement, erosion, or undermining
- [ ] Review load on platforms against rated capacity
- [ ] Inspect clamps/couplers (tube-and-clamp systems) for proper torque
- [ ] Check wire rope condition (suspended scaffolds) — no broken wires, kinks, corrosion
- [ ] Document findings — signed and dated by competent person, filed on-site

### Special Inspections Required After:

- **High wind event (>25 mph sustained)**
- **Rain/ice storm**
- **Seismic event**
- **Vehicle or equipment contact with scaffold**
- **Any modification, alteration, or relocation**
- **Period of scaffold non-use exceeding 7 days**

---

## 9. TIE-IN REQUIREMENTS

### Frame Scaffold Tie-Ins

**Vertical spacing:** Maximum **26 feet** (every 4th lift on 6'-6" frames)
**Horizontal spacing:** Maximum **30 feet** along the scaffold length

### Tie-In Pattern — First Tie

- **First tie at 4x minimum base width** or **20 feet** — whichever is LESS
- Example: 5-foot wide scaffold base = first tie at 20 feet (4 x 5' = 20', which equals 20' max)
- Example: 3-foot wide scaffold base = first tie at 12 feet (4 x 3' = 12', which is less than 20')

### System Scaffold Tie-Ins

- **Per manufacturer requirements** — typically more frequent than frame scaffold
- Always follow the erection manual — deviations require engineering approval

### Tie-In Methods

| Method | Application | Capacity |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Through-wall tie (tube through window/opening)** | Best — positive connection in both directions (push and pull) | High |
| **Anchor bolt to structure** | Good — expansion anchor or through-bolt into concrete/steel | Medium-High |
| **Wire tie to structure** | Acceptable for tension (pull) only — needs separate push restraint | Low (tension only) |
| **Reveal tube (wedged in window opening)** | Good for push/pull if properly wedged | Medium |

**Rules:**
- Ties must resist both **push (wind toward building)** and **pull (wind away from building)** forces
- Wire ties only resist pull — must pair with a rigid push restraint (deadman, brace to structure)
- Never tie to conduit, handrails, window frames, or non-structural elements
- Document all tie-in locations on scaffold erection drawing

---

## 10. SPECIAL SCAFFOLD TYPES

### Rolling/Mobile Scaffolds

- **Lock ALL casters before anyone climbs on** — no exceptions
- **No riders** — no one on the scaffold during relocation
- **Level surface only** — maximum 3° slope on travel surface
- **Maximum height = 4x minimum base width** (outdoors) or **4x base** (indoors with outriggers to increase effective base)
- **Apply force at base level to move** — never push from the platform
- **Watch for overhead obstructions and power lines** during relocation
- **Floor holes, edges, and drop-offs** in the travel path — barricade or cover before use

### Cantilever Scaffolds

- **Must be designed by qualified person** — loading is different from standard scaffold
- **Needle beams must be secured against rotation and displacement**
- **Counterweight or tie-back required** — the inboard end must resist overturning moment
- **Do NOT exceed design load** — cantilever scaffolds have less margin for overload

### Outrigger Scaffolds

- **Outrigger beams secured to structure** and braced against rotation
- **Platform limited to 3 feet wide** (standard) unless specifically engineered wider
- **Counterweight system must be rigid** — no sand bags or loose weights

---

## 11. DISMANTLING PROCEDURES

### General Rules

1. **Reverse of erection sequence** — last component erected is first removed
2. **Competent person must supervise** dismantling
3. **Red tag the scaffold** before starting — no access during dismantling
4. **Establish exclusion zone below** — barricade or post a signal person
5. **Never throw components to the ground** — use material hoist, rope, or hand-pass down
6. **Remove platforms before removing bracing at that level** — prevents workers from stepping on unguarded levels
7. **Bracing removed LAST at each level** — structure depends on bracing for stability

### Dismantling Sequence (Frame Scaffold)

1. Red tag all access points — clear all workers, tools, and materials from scaffold
2. Establish ground-level exclusion zone — barricade tape minimum, flag person if near traffic
3. Start at top level — remove guardrails
4. Remove planking/decks — lower to ground or pass down
5. Remove cross-braces at top level
6. Remove top frames — lift off coupling pins, lower to ground
7. Repeat down each level: guardrails → planks → braces → frames
8. Remove base-level braces last
9. Remove base frames and base plates
10. Remove mudsills — inspect and salvage if reusable
11. Clean and stack all components by type — inspect for damage during stacking

### Component Inspection During Dismantling

- **Bent or damaged frames:** Tag and remove from inventory — do NOT re-use
- **Cracked or split planks:** Destroy or clearly mark as condemned
- **Worn coupling pins or locks:** Replace before next use
- **Bent or stripped screw jacks:** Remove from service
- **Damaged cross-braces:** Do not attempt to straighten — replace

---

## 12. WEATHER AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Wind Limits

| Wind Speed | Action Required |
|------------|----------------|
| **0-20 mph** | Normal operations — inspect tie-ins |
| **20-30 mph** | Caution — secure loose materials, review tie-ins, monitor conditions |
| **30-40 mph** | Suspend work on scaffold — remove tarps/screens (wind sail effect), secure tools |
| **>40 mph** | All personnel off scaffold — inspect before resuming work |

**Wind screens/tarps:** Dramatically increase wind load on scaffold — scaffold must be engineered for the added load or screens must be removed before high winds.

### Ice and Snow

- **Remove ice and snow from platforms before use** — treat with sand or ice melt if needed
- **Inspect for ice accumulation on frames and connections** — ice can hide damage
- **Freeze/thaw on soil base:** Can cause settlement — check level after thaw cycles
- **Tarps can hold water/snow weight** — accumulated load can exceed capacity

### Lightning

- **Metal scaffold is a lightning conductor** — evacuate scaffold when lightning is within 10 miles (30-second flash-to-bang rule)
- **Do not resume work until 30 minutes after last observed lightning**

---

## 13. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS

### Required On-Site Records

- **Scaffold erection drawings** (or manufacturer's standard configuration guides)
- **Competent person designation letter** with training documentation
- **Daily inspection logs** signed by competent person
- **Scaffold user training records** for all workers who access scaffolds
- **Tag change log** — date, reason, old tag, new tag, competent person name
- **Any engineering letters** for modifications, unusual configurations, or heavy-duty loading
- **Wind monitoring records** when operating in high-wind areas

### Recommended Practices

- Photograph scaffold at completion of erection (before tag)
- Photograph any damage or deficiency found during inspection
- Keep manufacturer erection manuals on site
- Post load capacity signage at each access point (in addition to tag)
- Maintain material inventory — track damaged/condemned components separately
