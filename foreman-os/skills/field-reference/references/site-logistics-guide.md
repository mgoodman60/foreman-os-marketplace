## 1. Crane Placement and Selection

### Crane Type Selection Matrix

| Crane Type | Best For | Load Range | Setup Time | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mobile Crane** | Multiple picks, changing locations, short-duration | Up to 500 tons | 2-4 hours | Moderate |
| **Rough Terrain** | Unimproved ground, self-propulsion needed | Up to 300 tons | 1-2 hours | Moderate-High |
| **Tower Crane** | Continuous operation, fixed location, high-rise | Up to 800 tons | 1-2 weeks | High (long-term cost-effective) |
| **Articulating Boom** | Confined spaces, maneuvering around obstacles | Up to 150 tons | 30 min - 1 hour | Moderate |

### Capacity Determination (Critical)
- **Total load weight**: Structural member weight + all rigging (spreader bars, slings, shackles, etc.)
- **Rigging weight**: Never assume negligible. Sling system alone can be 500-1,500 lbs for heavy picks.
- **Capacity curve**: Capacity DECREASES with radius and height
- **Always consult load chart**: Crane manufacturer load chart is binding; never assume capacity without documentation
- **Safety factor**: 5:1 minimum (lift load / safe working load)

### Load Chart Example (Typical Mobile Crane)
```
AT 100 FEET BOOM LENGTH:
- At 50 ft radius: 45,000 lbs capacity
- At 75 ft radius: 28,000 lbs capacity
- At 100 ft radius: 18,000 lbs capacity
- At 150 ft radius: 8,000 lbs capacity
```
*Actual capacity varies by model and configuration. ALWAYS verify with actual load chart.*

### Crane Pad Requirements
- **Ground capacity**: Soil must support outrigger loads (typically 40,000-80,000 lbs per pad for mobile cranes)
- **Pad construction**: Timber mats (hardwood), steel plate, or composite systems
- **Pad size**: Minimum 4' × 4' per outrigger; larger pads for soft soils
- **Thickness**: Typically 12 inches hardwood lumber (properly seasoned and graded)
- **Bearing capacity**: Structural engineer calculates for soil type (sand, clay, fill)
- **Preparation**: Level ground, remove vegetation and obstructions
- **Inspection**: Superintendent inspects pads before crane arrival; subgrade must be stable

### Swing Radius and Clear Zone
- **Define swing radius**: Tail swing radius + 3 feet minimum clearance required
- **Barricade and signage**: All areas within swing radius must be barricaded and signed
- **Personnel exclusion**: No workers in swing zone during lifts
- **Equipment movement**: Verify equipment and temporary structures won't enter swing zone
- **Site control**: Project manager responsible for maintaining clear zone throughout crane operation

### Power Line Clearance
- **Regulation**: OSHA and ANSI standards require minimum clearance from electrical lines
- **Clearance distances**:
  - Up to 350 kV: minimum 20 feet
  - 350-500 kV: minimum 25 feet
  - 500+ kV: minimum 35 feet
- **Utility notification**: Contact local utility company for exact clearance requirements (may be higher)
- **"Safe" distance**: Use the higher of OSHA requirement or utility specification
- **Violation consequence**: Electrocution (fatal), property damage, project shutdown

### Lift Plan Requirement
**Lift plans REQUIRED for:**
- Any pick exceeding 75% of crane capacity
- Personnel lifts (basket/cage)
- Multi-crane lifts
- Blind picks (operator can't see landing)
- Heavy structural members with complex rigging
- Long-radius picks (>60% of maximum boom length)

**Lift plan must include:**
- Item weight and center of gravity
- Rigging configuration (slings, spreader bars, angles)
- Load calculation (item + rigging weight)
- Crane configuration (boom length, angle, position)
- Load chart verification (written confirmation within safe working load)
- Site layout showing crane position, swing radius, landing zone
- Weather conditions acceptable for operation
- Communication plan (radio channels, signal person)
- Emergency procedures (load drop protocol, power line contact)

### Pre-Lift Checklist
- Load weight verified on delivery ticket or design drawing
- Rigging equipment inspected (no damage, current certification)
- Crane operator briefed on lift plan
- Site cleared of personnel; barricades in place
- Signal person assigned and positioned for full visibility
- Weather conditions acceptable (wind speed < manufacturer limit, no rain/ice on lines)
- Load test performed if new configuration (light load verified)

## 2. Material Staging

### Strategic Staging (Minimize Double-Handling)
- **Location**: Stage materials as close to installation point as practical
- **Sequence**: Organize by erection sequence; first materials on bottom of pile
- **Visibility**: Keep piece marks visible for identification during installation
- **Accessibility**: Don't bury materials needed early under materials needed late
- **Traffic**: Never stage in emergency access, fire lanes, or primary egress paths

### Material-Specific Staging Requirements

#### Structural Steel
- **Organization**: Separate pieces by erection sequence, contract lot, or floor
- **Piece marks**: Clearly visible from ground level (painted or labeled)
- **Protection**: Keep clean and dry; cover from precipitation if stored >2 weeks
- **Stacking height**: Per AISC guidelines (typical 8-10 feet for light sections, less for heavy beams)
- **Blocking**: Solid blocking between layers (don't use shims or small blocks — they collapse)
- **Paint**: Protect paint from damage; repair scuffs and rust before installation

#### Concrete Forms and Shoring
- **Stage near pour location**: Minimize transport distance (reduce labor, equipment time)
- **Organize by use**: Vertical shores, walers, decking separated for quick access
- **Condition**: Inspect for damage, warping, bent hardware before staging
- **Weather protection**: Cover from weather (warping affects fit and quality)
- **Stack height**: Per manufacturer recommendations (typically 4-6 feet for plywood forms)

#### Drywall (Wallboard)
- **Storage**: Indoors or covered (never exposed to weather)
- **Stacking**: Flat on floor, maximum 12 sheets per stack
- **Spacing**: Air space between stacks for ventilation (prevents mold)
- **Slope**: Slight slope for drainage if stored outdoors under cover
- **Support**: Continuous support under entire stack (no point loads or sagging)
- **Moisture protection**: Plastic vapor barrier on floor; monitor humidity

#### Lumber and Framing
- **Elevation**: Dunnage (wood blocks) on ground to prevent moisture wicking
- **Spacing**: Air gaps between units for ventilation
- **Weather protection**: Tarp cover, but allow air circulation underneath
- **Separation by grade/size**: Keep rough framing separate from finish lumber
- **Identification**: Species, grade, and size clearly marked (tag or label each pile)

#### MEP Equipment (HVAC, Electrical, Plumbing)
- **Protected area**: Stage in secure, weather-protected location (job trailer or temporary enclosure)
- **Delivery inspection**: Verify condition immediately upon arrival (document damage for claims)
- **Storage requirements**: Check manufacturer data:
  - HVAC units: Keep upright, protect from dirt, cover openings
  - Boilers: Prevent rust (inspect for corrosion protection)
  - Electrical equipment: Keep dry, protect from moisture
  - Pumps: Seal openings, maintain orientation per spec
- **Inventory control**: Track delivered equipment against purchase orders; identify long-lead items
- **Security**: High-value equipment in locked container or fenced area

### Material Security (Theft Prevention)
- **High-theft items**: Copper wire/tubing, power tools, small equipment, HVAC controls
- **Staging location**: Fenced area or locked container within job trailer
- **Visibility**: Don't hide materials where theft isn't noticed
- **Inventory tracking**: Daily count of portable high-value items
- **Lighting**: Area well-lit at night (deters theft)
- **Signage**: Security signage on fenced area ("Authorized Personnel Only")

### Emergency Access and Fire Lanes (Non-Negotiable)
- **Fire lanes**: Minimum 12 feet wide, kept clear of materials and equipment
- **Emergency egress**: All exits remain unobstructed and clearly marked
- **Accessibility**: Route for emergency vehicles marked and maintained
- **Checkpoint**: Regular site walks to ensure compliance; enforce with trade workers

## 3. Temporary Power

### Service Sizing and Load Calculation

#### Typical Load Estimates (By Equipment Type)
- **Arc welder**: 40-60 amps per machine
- **Hand tools** (circular saw, impact drill): 15 amps each
- **Power hand saws**: 20-30 amps
- **Heating (job site heater)**: 20-40 amps depending on size
- **Temporary lighting**: 5-20 amps depending on circuits
- **Office trailer**: 100-200 amps (includes HVAC, lighting, receptacles)
- **Small compressor**: 15-25 amps
- **Large compressor**: 50+ amps
- **Mortar mixer**: 15-20 amps

#### Service Calculation
- **Total connected load**: Sum all equipment likely to run simultaneously
- **Safety factor**: Multiply by 1.25 (code requirement, accounts for peak loads and growth)
- **Example**:
  - Welder (50A) + Compressor (20A) + Tools (30A) + Lighting (20A) = 120A total
  - 120A × 1.25 = 150A minimum service required
  - Order 200A service (provides growth capacity)

### GFCI Protection (OSHA Mandatory)
- **Requirement**: ALL 15-amp and 20-amp, 120-volt receptacles must have GFCI protection
- **Method 1 - GFCI breakers**: GFCI circuit breaker at temporary panel (protects entire circuit)
- **Method 2 - GFCI receptacles**: Individual GFCI outlet at each location
- **Advantages of breaker-level**: Single point of protection, fewer outlets needed
- **Monthly testing**: Push test button monthly to verify function (red = tripped, black = reset)
- **Documentation**: Maintain log of GFCI testing dates and results

### Assured Grounding Program (Alternative to GFCI)
- **When used**: Primarily for power-hungry equipment (welders, larger tools) that won't tolerate GFCI nuisance trips
- **Inspection method**: Visual inspection + electrical testing
- **Testing frequency**: Monthly minimum (some projects require more frequent)
- **Color-coded tags**:
  - Green = Recently tested and passed (within 30 days)
  - Yellow = Tested but failed (remove from service immediately)
  - Red = Not tested (remove from service)
- **Tests performed**: Ground continuity (ground wire intact), polarity, and voltage
- **Training required**: OSHA requires training on assured grounding program procedures

### Spider Boxes (Temporary Power Distribution)
- **Purpose**: Distribute power from main temporary panel to work areas without excessive cord runs
- **Locations**: Strategic points across site (one per 100-150 feet typical)
- **Cord runs**: From main panel to spider, then to equipment (minimize cord length)
- **GFCI on boxes**: Smaller spider boxes should have GFCI protection on downstream receptacles
- **Labeling**: Clearly labeled with amp rating and number of available receptacles

### Generator Sizing (If Used for Primary Power)
- **Total connected load calculation**: Sum expected simultaneous load (same method as above)
- **Motor starting surge**: Motors draw 3× running amperage for starting (account in sizing)
- **Formula**: (Total continuous load + motor starting load) × 1.25
- **Example**:
  - Compressor 20A running, 60A starting (3×)
  - HVAC unit 50A running, 150A starting
  - Total: (20+50 = 70A) + (150A surge) = 220A peak × 1.25 = 275A generator minimum
  - Select 300-350 kW generator for safety margin

### Temporary Lighting (OSHA 1926.56 Minimum Standards)

| Work Type | Foot-Candles | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **General work areas** | 5 | Foundation, framing, rough trade work |
| **Office, first aid, stairways** | 10 | Adequate for safety and clerical work |
| **Detailed work** (drywall, finishes) | 30 | Precision work, finish quality critical |
| **Hazardous areas** | Varies | Excavations, trenches typically require 5-10 |

- **Measurement**: Footcandles measured at floor or work surface (not ambient in air)
- **Equipment**: Temporary lights on towers, mounted on trailers, or rigged to structures
- **Placement**: Distributed to minimize shadows; typically 40-foot spacing between poles
- **Safety**: Light standards guyed for wind stability; no damage to rigging points

## 4. Dewatering Methods

### Decision Framework: Soil Type and Depth

| Method | Best For | Depth | Cost | Setup Time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Sump pump** | Shallow excavation, low inflow | <10 ft | Low | 1-2 hours |
| **Wellpoint system** | Sandy/silty soils, sustained dewatering | 10-30 ft | Moderate | 1-2 days |
| **Deep wells** | Deep excavations, high inflow | 30+ ft | Moderate-High | 2-5 days |
| **Eductor wells** | Low-permeability soils, maximum lowering | 30+ ft | High | 2-5 days |

### Sump Pumping (Simplest Method)
- **Application**: Shallow excavation, limited groundwater inflow, temporary dewatering
- **Installation**: Excavate sump pit (typically 4' × 6' × 4' deep) at low point
- **Pump selection**: Centrifugal pump rated for debris (2-4 inch pump typical for construction)
- **Power**: Electric pump (requires power) or diesel pump (mobility, independence from site power)
- **Discharge**: Sloped drain line to settling area or storm drain (with permission)
- **Monitoring**: Daily water level check; add pump capacity if water rises faster than evacuation
- **Limitation**: Only effective for shallow excavations; inflow rate determines feasibility

### Wellpoint System (Most Common for Sustained Work)
- **Configuration**: Series of 1-1.5 inch diameter wells spaced 5-10 feet apart
- **Connection**: Header pipe connects all wells to vacuum pump and discharge
- **Pump**: Jet-type or vacuum pump (creates negative pressure to draw water from soil)
- **Soil suitability**: Works well in sand, silt, and fine gravel; less effective in clay
- **Depth range**: 10-30 feet below pump location (30 feet is maximum effective depth)
- **Spacing**: Closer wells in poor-draining soils; wider spacing in sandy soils
- **Dewatering radius**: Typically 15-30 feet from wellpoint line (affected by soil permeability)
- **Monitoring**: Check vacuum gauge (typically 12-15 inches Hg for peak efficiency)
- **Timeline**: 1-2 days setup; can dewater continuously for duration of project

### Deep Well System (For Deep Excavations)
- **Wells**: 4-8 inch diameter wells, drilled to sufficient depth
- **Pump**: Submersible pump in each well (or inside large diameter well)
- **Capacity**: Higher flow rate than wellpoints (suitable for higher inflow)
- **Depth**: Unlimited (constrained by drilling depth, not pump type)
- **Spacing**: 20-50 feet depending on soil and drawdown requirement
- **Monitoring**: Measure depth to water; adjust pump capacity as needed
- **Power**: Electric submersible pumps (standard for construction)

### Eductor Well System (Low-Permeability Challenge)
- **Application**: Silts, clays, low-permeability soils where standard methods fail
- **Mechanism**: Jet pump creates local low pressure in well, drawing water from surrounding soil
- **Effectiveness**: Can lower water table 50+ feet where vacuum-based systems ineffective
- **Cost**: Most expensive method (requires specialized equipment and expertise)
- **Setup time**: 3-5 days including exploratory boring and system design
- **Use case**: Deep excavations in clay or silt, when other methods proven ineffective

### Discharge Water Management (Regulatory)
- **Permit requirements**: Most jurisdictions require dewatering discharge permit
- **Pre-treatment**: Sediment settling basin (minimum 24-hour retention) before discharge
- **Testing**: May require pH testing, sediment analysis, contamination screening
- **Discharge location**: Approved storm drain, sediment basin, or site perimeter (if permitted)
- **Never to**: Sanitary sewer, wetlands, or streams without written permit
- **Responsible party**: Contractor responsible for discharge compliance; superintendent verifies

### SWPPP Compliance (Stormwater Pollution Prevention)
- **Sediment control**: Dewatering discharge typically routed through sediment control BMP
- **Settling basin**: 2-4 foot depth, volume = minimum 24 hours of expected discharge (estimated flow rate × 24 hours)
- **Outlets**: Perforated discharge line at bottom; outflow at top maintains level
- **Maintenance**: Remove accumulated sediment when 6-12 inches of sediment accumulates
- **Sediment disposal**: Haul to approved disposal site (don't stockpile on-site or discharge untreated)

### Key Decision Point
**Before starting dewatering:**
1. Review soil boring report (permeability, water table elevation)
2. Estimate inflow rate (depends on soil permeability and excavation area)
3. Measure site elevation relative to water table (may require test boring)
4. Select method based on depth, inflow, and soil type
5. Verify discharge requirements with local engineer and permitting authority

### OSHA Respirable Silica Rules (Critical for Concrete/Masonry)
- **Threshold**: Work triggering respirable silica exposure:
  - Concrete cutting, grinding, drilling, demolition
  - Brick/masonry cutting or grinding
  - Concrete saw cutting (wet or dry)
- **Control methods (Hierarchy)**:
  1. **Wet cutting**: Use wet saw or water spray during cutting (most effective)
  2. **Dust collection**: HEPA-filter vacuum on cutting tool or grinder
  3. **Respiratory protection**: NIOSH-approved respirator (N95 or P100 minimum; verify per Table 1)
