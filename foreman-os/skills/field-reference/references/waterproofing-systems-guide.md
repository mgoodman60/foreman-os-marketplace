## 1. BELOW-GRADE WATERPROOFING SYSTEMS

### System Comparison Table

| System | Thickness | Crack Bridging | Application Temp | Repairability | Relative Cost | Best For |
|--------|-----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| **Sheet Membrane (self-adhered)** | 40-60 mil | Moderate (1/16"-1/8") | 40°F+ (primer required) | Fair — patch with same material | Medium | Foundation walls, conventional placement |
| **Spray-Applied Polyurethane** | 60-80 mil | Good (up to 1/8") | 25°F+ (varies) | Easy — spray over repair area | Medium-High | Complex geometry, fast schedule |
| **Bentonite Panels/Sheets** | 3/16"-1/4" panel | Self-healing (swells when wet) | Any (dry install) | Good — self-heals small punctures | Medium | Blind-side (against soil before concrete pour) |
| **Crystalline Admixture** | Integral (no membrane) | Self-healing (up to 0.4mm) | Mixed into concrete | Excellent — permanent, self-healing | Low-Medium | New concrete, where membrane access is impossible |
| **Cementitious Coating** | 30-60 mil | Poor | 40°F+ | Easy — recoat | Low | Damp-proofing (NOT true waterproofing), minor moisture control |
| **Hot-Applied Rubberized Asphalt** | 120-180 mil | Excellent (up to 1/4") | Applied at 400°F+ | Fair — heat and reapply | High | Plaza decks, below-grade parking, critical structures |

### Selection Criteria Decision Table

| Condition | Recommended System(s) | Avoid |
|-----------|-----------------------|-------|
| **High water table (hydrostatic pressure)** | Sheet membrane + drainage board, spray-applied, or hot-applied rubberized asphalt | Cementitious coating (not waterproof under pressure) |
| **Blind-side application (pour against soil/shoring)** | Bentonite panels or spray-applied to shoring | Self-adhered sheet (needs concrete substrate) |
| **Complex geometry (many penetrations, corners)** | Spray-applied (seamless) | Sheet membrane (difficult to detail around complex shapes) |
| **Post-tensioned structure (crack concern)** | Crystalline admixture + sheet membrane redundancy | Single-system reliance |
| **Budget-critical, low moisture exposure** | Cementitious coating (damp-proofing only) | Don't call it "waterproofing" — it is moisture resistance only |
| **Below-grade parking structure** | Hot-applied rubberized asphalt or spray-applied | Thin coatings (traffic/wear will compromise) |

## 2. FOUNDATION WALL WATERPROOFING PROCEDURE

### Step-by-Step (Self-Adhered Sheet Membrane)

1. **Surface Preparation**
   - Concrete must be cured minimum 7 days (28 days preferred for crystalline systems)
   - Remove form ties — snap flush or cut; patch tie holes with non-shrink grout
   - Grind or patch all honeycombs, voids, and protrusions
   - Surface must be smooth — no fins, ridges, or sharp projections >1/8"
   - Surface must be clean and dry — no standing water, dust, oil, or form release agent residue
   - Concrete moisture content below 5% (test with moisture meter or plastic sheet test)

2. **Primer Application**
   - Apply manufacturer's recommended primer to entire surface
   - Coverage rate: typically 200-300 SF per gallon (check product data sheet)
   - Allow primer to dry to tack (touch-dry, 1-4 hours depending on temperature and humidity)
   - **Primer is mandatory** — membrane will not bond without it

3. **Membrane Installation**
   - Start at bottom of wall — first sheet overlaps footing/slab joint by minimum 6"
   - Unroll membrane horizontally along wall, pressing into place as you go
   - **Overlap minimum 3" at side laps** (horizontal), **6" at end laps** (vertical)
   - Roll all laps with hand roller — firm, consistent pressure
   - Seal all edges with membrane mastic or detail tape
   - **Inside corners:** Pre-form membrane or use pre-fabricated corner boots
   - **Outside corners:** Wrap continuously around corner — minimum 6" past corner in each direction
   - **Penetrations (pipes, conduits):** Cut membrane to fit tightly; seal with mastic and reinforcing membrane strip minimum 6" beyond penetration in all directions
   - **Transitions (wall-to-footing):** Cant strip or fillet (45-degree transition) before membrane; membrane must bridge the joint without bridging a sharp angle

4. **Protection Board**
   - Install rigid protection board over membrane BEFORE backfill — 1/4" minimum thickness (HDPE or XPS insulation)
   - Protection board prevents membrane puncture during backfill
   - Adhere with compatible adhesive or mechanical fasteners through membrane at top only (above grade line)
   - **No protection board = membrane will be damaged during backfill — guaranteed**

5. **Drainage Mat (where required)**
   - Install geocomposite drainage board over protection board
   - Drainage board channels water downward to footing drain
   - Required when water table is within 5 feet of foundation or when hydrostatic conditions exist
   - Filter fabric faces soil side — prevents fines from clogging drainage core

6. **Backfill**
   - Use granular backfill (Class I or II per ASTM D2321) for first 12" against protection board
   - **No rocks, debris, or sharp objects in first 12"** — use clean sand or pea gravel
   - Compact carefully — hand-operated compactor only within 3 feet of wall
   - Heavy equipment backfilling too close to wall is the #1 cause of membrane damage
   - Do NOT backfill until waterproofing has been inspected and approved

## 3. BELOW-SLAB WATERPROOFING

### Underslab Vapor Barrier

**Standard: ASTM E1745**

| Class | Permeance (perms) | Puncture Resistance | Use |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|-----|
| **Class A** | ≤0.01 perms | Highest (2,200g minimum) | High-moisture conditions, conditioned spaces, critical interiors |
| **Class B** | ≤0.01 perms | Moderate (1,700g minimum) | Standard commercial construction |
| **Class C** | ≤0.01 perms | Lower (1,100g minimum) | Residential, low-risk applications |

### Installation Requirements

- **Minimum thickness: 15 mil** (most commercial specs require 15-20 mil; 10 mil is minimum code but inadequate for commercial)
- **Overlap laps minimum 6"** — seal with manufacturer's tape or mastic (tape preferred)
- **Seal ALL penetrations:** Pipes, conduits, pile caps, columns — use mastic and reinforcing patch
- **Turn up at perimeter:** Extend vapor barrier minimum 4" up the face of foundation wall or grade beam
- **Under rebar:** Install vapor barrier BEFORE placing rebar chairs and rebar — protect from puncture during rebar installation
- **Protection during rebar placement:** Walk boards, plywood sheets, or sand layer (1-2" sand cushion) over vapor barrier before rebar work
- **Granular fill below vapor barrier:** 4" minimum clean, compacted granular fill (no capillary rise)
- **No penetrations through vapor barrier by rebar chairs** if possible — use plastic-tipped or sand-cushion chairs

### Common Below-Slab Mistakes

- Using 6 mil poly (too thin — punctures during construction; not ASTM E1745 rated)
- Not taping laps — moisture migrates through untaped overlaps
- Puncturing during rebar placement and not repairing — each puncture is a moisture path
- Not extending up at perimeter — edge migration defeats the purpose
- Placing directly on rough subgrade without granular cushion — puncture from stones

## 4. ABOVE-GRADE WATERPROOFING

### Plaza/Podium Deck Waterproofing

**System Stack (top to bottom):**
1. Wearing surface (pavers, topping slab, or traffic coating)
2. Protection course (drainage mat or protection board)
3. Waterproofing membrane (hot-applied rubberized asphalt is gold standard)
4. Primer
5. Structural concrete deck (minimum 28-day cure before waterproofing)

**Key Requirements:**
- **Slope to drain:** 2% minimum (1/4" per foot) — dead-flat decks will pond and leak
- **Membrane thickness:** 120-180 mil for hot-applied; 60-80 mil for spray-applied
- **Flashing at walls:** Turn membrane up minimum 8" above finish grade of wearing surface
- **Drains:** Set drains LOW — membrane must slope into drain; clamp ring seals membrane to drain body
- **Expansion joints:** Carry through wearing surface AND waterproofing — special expansion joint detail required

### Traffic Coatings

| Type | Use | Thickness | Movement Capability | Cure Time |
|------|-----|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Polyurethane (vehicular)** | Parking decks, drive lanes | 40-60 mil | ±25% | 24-48 hours per coat |
| **Polyurethane (pedestrian)** | Walkways, balconies | 30-40 mil | ±25% | 24 hours per coat |
| **Epoxy** | Interior parking, heavy traffic | 20-40 mil | Rigid — no movement | 12-24 hours |
| **MMA (Methyl Methacrylate)** | Rapid return to service | 40-80 mil | Moderate | 1-2 hours |

**Traffic Coating Rules:**
- **Slope to drain:** 2% minimum — no ponding on traffic coatings
- **Surface prep critical:** Shot-blast or grind concrete to CSP 3-5 (Concrete Surface Profile); no laitance, sealers, or coatings
- **Moisture testing:** Concrete moisture must be below manufacturer's threshold (typically <5% by calcium chloride test or <75% RH by in-situ probe)
- **Multiple coats:** Typically 2-3 coats with aggregate broadcast between coats for slip resistance
- **Recoat window:** Apply next coat within manufacturer's recoat window — if exceeded, must abrade surface

### Balcony Waterproofing

- **Pan flashing at door threshold:** Sheet metal or membrane pan extending minimum 4" up behind door frame, sloped toward exterior
- **Turn membrane up minimum 4"** above finished floor at building wall interface
- **Slope AWAY from building:** 2% minimum toward balcony edge/drain
- **Drip edge at balcony perimeter:** Prevent water from running back under slab
- **Through-wall scupper or drain** if balcony is enclosed by parapet — do NOT rely on overflow alone

### Green/Vegetated Roofs

**System Layers (top to bottom):**
1. Vegetation and growing medium (4-6" extensive, 8-24"+ intensive)
2. Filter fabric (geotextile — prevents fines from clogging drainage)
3. Drainage layer (molded HDPE panels or granular)
4. Root barrier (copper or chemical-treated sheet — prevents roots from penetrating membrane)
5. Waterproofing membrane (must be root-resistant; hot-applied rubberized asphalt or PVC)
6. Protection board/insulation
7. Structural deck

**Superintendent Concerns:**
- **Weight:** Saturated extensive green roof = 15-35 PSF; intensive = 50-150+ PSF — verify structural capacity
- **Drainage must function** — clogged drainage causes overload and leaks
- **Leak detection:** Consider electronic leak detection under membrane before covering
- **Irrigation:** Most extensive systems need irrigation during establishment (first 1-2 years)

## 5. JOINT SEALANTS

### Sealant Selection Table

| Type | Movement (±%) | UV Resistance | Paintable | Adhesion | Life (years) | Best For |
|------|--------------|---------------|-----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Silicone** | ±50% | Excellent | NO | Good (with primer) | 20-30 | Exterior curtain wall, storefront, metal/glass joints |
| **Polyurethane** | ±25% | Fair-Good | YES | Excellent | 10-20 | Horizontal traffic joints, concrete joints, paintable exterior |
| **Polysulfide** | ±25% | Fair | YES | Good | 15-20 | Fuel/chemical resistant: parking, industrial, jet fuel areas |
| **Hybrid (STPE/MS Polymer)** | ±50% | Good | YES | Excellent | 20+ | Increasingly replacing polyurethane — versatile, paintable, high movement |
| **Acrylic Latex** | ±7% | Fair | YES | Poor | 5-10 | Interior only, non-moving joints, painter's caulk |
| **Butyl** | ±10% | Fair | NO | Fair | 10-15 | Concealed joints, lap sealant under flashing, low movement |

### Joint Design Rules

**Width:**
- **Minimum joint width = 2x expected movement** — a joint that moves 1/4" needs to be minimum 1/2" wide
- **Practical minimum:** 1/4" for silicone, 3/8" for polyurethane, 1/2" for most field joints
- **Maximum:** 2" (wider joints require special engineering)

**Depth:**
- **Depth = 1/2 of width** for joints 1/4" to 1/2" wide
- **Depth = 1/2" maximum** for joints wider than 1"
- **Never deeper than wide** — hourglass shape causes sealant failure at center

**Backer Rod:**
- **Closed-cell polyethylene** for most joints — 25% larger diameter than joint width (compresses to fit)
- **Open-cell backer rod** for sealant that needs outgassing during cure (some polyurethanes)
- **Bond breaker tape** at bottom of joint if backer rod won't fit — prevents 3-sided adhesion
- **Why backer rod matters:** Without it, sealant bonds to three sides (two faces + bottom), creating stress concentration that causes premature failure

**Primer:**
- **Always follow manufacturer's primer recommendation** — primer is NOT optional when specified
- **Primer increases adhesion 2-5x** on porous surfaces (concrete, CMU, stone)
- **Apply primer with brush or dauber** — thin, uniform coat; allow to dry per product instructions
- **Primer shelf life is short** (6-12 months typical) — check date before use

### Sealant Installation Procedure

1. **Joint preparation:** Clean both faces of joint — remove old sealant, laitance, dust, oil, coatings; use mechanical cleaning (grinder, wire brush) or solvent wipe
2. **Mask adjacent surfaces** with painter's tape — clean sealant lines are a quality indicator
3. **Install backer rod** to correct depth — push in with blunt tool, do NOT puncture rod
4. **Apply primer** to both joint faces — allow to dry (20-60 minutes typical)
5. **Gun sealant** from bottom up on vertical joints; from one end on horizontal — fill completely, no voids
6. **Tool sealant** immediately — concave profile for best performance and appearance; tool within 5-10 minutes
7. **Remove masking tape** before sealant skins — typically within 15-30 minutes of application
8. **Protect from rain** for minimum 24 hours (polyurethane); silicone can get wet sooner (check data sheet)

## 6. AIR AND VAPOR BARRIERS

### WRB (Weather-Resistive Barrier) Types

| Type | Application | Permeance | Air Barrier? | Cost | Best For |
|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|------|----------|
| **Mechanically-attached sheet (Tyvek, etc.)** | Stapled/taped to sheathing | 50+ perms (vapor open) | Yes (with taped seams) | Low | Wood/steel frame, residential, low-rise commercial |
| **Self-adhered sheet membrane** | Peel-and-stick to sheathing | 1-15 perms (varies) | Yes | Medium | Commercial, high-performance walls, below-grade transition |
| **Fluid-applied membrane** | Spray or roller to sheathing | 5-15 perms (varies) | Yes | Medium-High | Complex geometry, high-rise, best continuity at transitions |
| **Closed-cell spray foam** | Sprayed to interior of sheathing | <1 perm at 2" | Yes (vapor retarder too) | High | Combined insulation/air/vapor barrier |

### Continuity Requirements

- **Air barrier must be continuous** from foundation to roof — every gap is an air leak
- **Critical transition points:** Foundation-to-wall, wall-to-window, wall-to-roof, wall-to-deck penetrations
- **Penetrations:** Every pipe, conduit, duct, and structural member that passes through the air barrier must be sealed with compatible sealant or transition membrane
- **Testing:** ASTM E2178 (material air permeance) and ASTM E2357 (assembly air leakage) — whole-building air leakage testing (blower door) may be required for high-performance buildings

### Detailing at Penetrations

- **Windows/doors:** Sill pan flashing first, then jamb and head flashing; air barrier laps OVER flashing at head, UNDER flashing at sill
- **Pipes/conduits:** Sheet membrane or liquid-applied membrane patch extending minimum 4" beyond penetration in all directions
- **Structural steel (through-wall):** Most difficult detail — thermal break required; air barrier sealed to steel with compatible sealant and membrane wrap
- **Shelf angles:** Continuous membrane behind shelf angle, sealed to angle with sealant and membrane strip

## 7. WATER TESTING STANDARDS

### Standard Testing Methods

| Standard | Method | Application | Duration | Acceptance |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **AAMA 501.1** | Field spray rack (calibrated nozzle) | Windows, curtain wall, storefront | 15 min per area | No water penetration at interior |
| **AAMA 501.2** | Spray nozzle (handheld) | Window/door frame perimeter, sealant joints | Varies | No water penetration |
| **ASTM E1105** | Calibrated spray rack | Wall assemblies, curtain wall systems | 15-60 min (per spec) | No water penetration at specified pressure |
| **Flood testing** | Pond water on horizontal surface | Roofs, plaza decks, balconies | 48 hours minimum (2" water depth) | No leaks detected below |
| **Hose test (informal)** | Garden hose at specific locations | Preliminary check, diagnostic | 5-15 min per area | No water penetration |

### Flood Testing Procedure (Roofs and Decks)

1. **Plug all drains** — use inflatable drain plugs or mechanical plugs
2. **Verify structural capacity** for water weight — 2" of water = 10.4 PSF (confirm with engineer)
3. **Fill to 2" depth minimum** — mark depth on parapet/curb with crayon
4. **Maintain water level for 48 hours minimum** (72 hours preferred for critical areas)
5. **Inspect underside** during test — mark any leak locations; photograph
6. **After test:** Unplug drains slowly (sudden release can overload drainage system)
7. **Document results** — test date, duration, water depth, any leaks found, photos

### When to Test

- **Before covering waterproofing** with topping, pavers, or green roof system
- **Before backfilling** below-grade waterproofing (visual inspection minimum; hose test preferred)
- **After window/curtain wall installation** — before interior finishes
- **After sealant installation** — before painting or covering
- **After any repair or remediation** — retest the repaired area plus 10 feet in each direction

## 8. COMMON WATERPROOFING FAILURES

### Below-Grade Failures

| Failure | Cause | Prevention |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Lap adhesion failure** | Insufficient overlap (<3"), no primer, cold application, dusty/damp surface | Verify overlap dimensions, prime surface, apply above 40°F, clean surface |
| **Membrane puncture during backfill** | No protection board, rocks in backfill, heavy equipment too close to wall | Install protection board, specify clean backfill, restrict equipment near wall |
| **Water at footing-wall joint** | No membrane transition at joint, no cant strip, sharp angle tears membrane | Install cant strip, wrap membrane continuously from footing to wall |
| **Penetration leaks** | Pipe or conduit through membrane not properly sealed | Detail each penetration with mastic + reinforcing membrane |
| **Inadequate drainage** | No drainage board, footing drain clogged or missing, grading directs water toward building | Install drainage board and footing drain, grade away from building minimum 5% for 10 feet |

### Above-Grade Failures

| Failure | Cause | Prevention |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Ponding on deck** | Insufficient slope (<2%), deflection creating low spots, blocked drains | Verify 2% minimum slope, check deflection, maintain drains |
| **Sealant joint failure** | Joint too narrow, no backer rod, 3-sided adhesion, wrong sealant type | Design joints 2x movement, install backer rod, select appropriate sealant |
| **Flashing failure** | Laps not sealed, termination not embedded, end dams missing | Seal all laps with mastic, embed termination bar, install end dams |
| **Traffic coating delamination** | Poor surface prep, moisture in concrete, exceeded recoat window | Shot-blast surface, test moisture, recoat on schedule |
| **Balcony leak at door threshold** | No pan flashing, membrane not turned up, slope toward building | Install pan flashing, turn up 4", verify slope away |

## 10. PRODUCT COMPATIBILITY

### Critical Compatibility Rules

- **Never assume products from different manufacturers are compatible** — sealant, primer, membrane, and protection board must all be from the same system or tested for compatibility
- **Silicone sealant does NOT bond to most membranes** — use polyurethane or hybrid at membrane transitions
- **Petroleum-based products (asphalt, bitumen) WILL dissolve certain membranes** — verify compatibility before adjacent use
- **Self-adhered membranes require specific primers** — generic primers may fail; always use manufacturer's recommended primer
- **Solvents in some sealants attack certain backer rod materials** — verify sealant/backer rod compatibility
- **EPDM and TPO are NOT compatible** — never lap or splice between these materials

### Warranty Considerations

- **Single-source warranty:** Best protection — one manufacturer provides membrane, primer, sealant, and flashing; responsible for entire system
- **Split-source:** Problematic — if leak occurs at joint between two manufacturers' products, both point fingers at the other
- **Warranty requires manufacturer's installation standards** — deviations void warranty
- **Pre-installation meeting with manufacturer's rep is standard** for critical waterproofing — schedule before work begins
- **Manufacturer inspection during installation** — many warranties require periodic manufacturer site visits; schedule these in advance

---

## 11. SEASONAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Cold Weather Waterproofing

| Product | Minimum Application Temp | Special Requirements |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Self-adhered sheet | 40°F (surface and ambient) | Warm membrane rolls in heated storage before application; use cold-temperature primer |
| Spray-applied polyurethane | 25-40°F (varies by product) | Faster setup, shorter working time; heat substrate if below 35°F |
| Hot-applied rubberized asphalt | Any (applied hot) | Material temperature critical (375-425°F); substrate must be dry |
| Sealants (most types) | 40°F minimum | Slower cure; may need longer tool time; protect from freezing |
| Bentonite panels | Any (dry installation) | Must be kept DRY until backfilled — bentonite activates prematurely if wetted |
| Fluid-applied WRB | 35-40°F minimum | Extended cure time; protect from freezing for 24 hours |

### Hot Weather Waterproofing

- **Self-adhered membrane:** Apply early morning or late afternoon — membrane becomes too aggressive in direct sun above 100°F (sticks to itself, difficult to position)
- **Spray-applied:** Shorter pot life; mix smaller batches; ensure adequate ventilation (fumes intensified by heat)
- **Sealants:** Tooling time shortened; work in smaller sections; joint expansion at installation means sealant in compression (good — install on warm day if possible)
- **Concrete moisture:** Hot/dry conditions may dry concrete surface while interior retains moisture — test before membrane application

---

## 12. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS

### Required for Waterproofing Systems

- **Product submittals:** Approved manufacturer, product name, data sheets for every component in the system
- **Substrate acceptance report:** Surface condition documented before waterproofing begins; signed by installer and GC
- **Daily installation log:** Areas covered, temperature/weather conditions, product lot numbers, any issues encountered
- **Adhesion/peel test results:** If required by manufacturer or spec — typically 3 tests per 1,000 SF
- **Lap and overlap verification:** Spot-check documentation of overlap dimensions
- **Penetration detail photos:** Every penetration photographed before covering
- **Flood test or water test results:** Date, duration, water depth, pass/fail, leak locations if any
- **Manufacturer inspection reports:** Signed by manufacturer's technical rep
- **Warranty documentation:** Application for warranty submitted to manufacturer with required installation records
- **Photos, photos, photos:** Waterproofing is covered permanently — if you don't photograph it, you can't prove it was done correctly
