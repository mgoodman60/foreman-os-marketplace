## 1. TEMPORARY POWER

### Service Sizing
Calculate total connected load, then apply demand factor to determine service size.

| Load Category | Typical Draw | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Job trailer (single-wide) | 100-200 amps | HVAC, lighting, computers, copier |
| Construction lighting (per floor) | 30-60 amps | String lighting + task lighting |
| Welding machines (each) | 50-100 amps | 200-400 amp welding units on 480V |
| Tower crane | 200-400 amps | Check crane electrical specs |
| Personnel/material hoist | 100-200 amps | Per hoist motor size |
| Concrete pump (electric) | 200-300 amps | Large draw, coordinate with utility |
| Small tools and general | 50-100 amps per spider box | Circular saws, drills, grinders |
| Temporary HVAC (per unit) | 30-100 amps | Depends on unit size |

**Demand factor:** Not all loads run simultaneously. Apply 0.60-0.80 demand factor to total connected load for service sizing.

**Typical service sizes:**
- Small commercial project: 200 amp, 120/208V 3-phase
- Medium commercial project: 400 amp, 120/208V or 277/480V 3-phase
- Large commercial project: 600-1,200 amp, 277/480V 3-phase with step-down transformers

### Distribution
**Main panel --> Distribution panels --> Spider boxes --> Outlets**

- **Main disconnect** — Lockable, weatherproof, accessible, labeled with voltage and amperage
- **Distribution panels** — Locate at central points on each floor/area. 100-200 amp sub-panels typical.
- **Step-down transformers** — 480V to 120/208V for small tools and lighting. Size for load, not just availability.
- **Spider boxes** — Temporary power distribution boxes with GFCI-protected receptacles

### Spider Box Requirements
- **GFCI protection** — Every 120V, 15- and 20-amp receptacle MUST be GFCI-protected per OSHA 1926.405(a)(2)(ii). No exceptions.
- **Weather-resistant** — Rated for outdoor/wet use (NEMA 3R minimum)
- **Centrally located** — One per active work area to minimize cord runs
- **Supported off ground** — On stand, hung from structure, or on elevated platform. Keep out of water.
- **Circuit breakers** — Properly sized for connected load, clearly labeled
- **Grounding** — Equipment grounding conductor continuous to main panel. Verify with meter monthly.

### GFCI Protection — OSHA Requirement
**OSHA 1926.405(a)(2)(ii):** All 120-volt, single-phase, 15- and 20-ampere receptacle outlets on construction sites that are not part of the permanent wiring of the building must have GFCI protection.

**Two acceptable methods:**
1. GFCI receptacles or GFCI breakers on all construction outlets (most common)
2. Assured Equipment Grounding Conductor Program (AEGCP) — written program, daily visual inspections, quarterly testing, color-coded by quarter. More burdensome but acceptable.

**Most superintendents use GFCI breakers/receptacles.** It is simpler, provides immediate protection, and requires less documentation.

### Cord Management
- **Elevate above traffic and water** — Hang from hooks, wire supports, or overhead cable. Minimum 7 feet above walkways.
- **Protect at doorways and stairs** — Cord covers or conduit where cords cross high-traffic areas
- **No daisy-chaining** — Do not plug power strip into power strip, or extension cord into extension cord
- **Maximum cord length** — 100 feet for 12-gauge, 50 feet for 14-gauge (voltage drop limits). For longer runs, use a closer spider box or larger gauge cord.
- **Daily inspection** — Look for damaged insulation, crushed conductors, missing ground prongs, overheating
- **Remove damaged cords immediately** — Cut the plug off and discard, or tag out of service for repair

### Generator Backup
- **Sizing:** Calculate critical loads that must run during power outage. Add 25% for starting surge on motor loads.
- **Critical operations:**
  - Personnel hoists (worker egress from upper floors)
  - Temporary fire pump (if building fire protection not yet permanent)
  - Welding operations on critical path
  - Concrete placement operations in progress
  - Winter heating (concrete curing, freeze protection)
- **Fuel storage:** Diesel day tanks on generator skid. Bulk fuel per NFPA 30 — 6 feet from buildings, containment dike, fire extinguisher within 50 feet.
- **Auto-transfer switch:** For critical loads, install ATS to switch to generator within 10 seconds of power loss
- **Noise:** Generators produce 65-90 dB at 25 feet. Consider noise ordinance limits, residential proximity. Locate away from offices and neighbors.

### Temporary Lighting Requirements

| Area | Minimum Illumination (Foot-Candles) | OSHA Reference |
|------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| General construction areas | 5 fc | 1926.56(a) |
| Active work areas (general) | 10 fc | Good practice |
| Concrete placement, form work | 10 fc | Good practice |
| Detailed finish work, inspection | 30 fc | Good practice |
| Stairways, corridors, exits | 5 fc | 1926.56(a) |
| Offices, first aid stations | 30 fc | 1926.56(a) |
| Shops (mechanical, electrical) | 10 fc | 1926.56(a) |

- **String lighting** — Maintain above head height (7-foot minimum clearance). Use guard cages on bulbs per OSHA 1926.405(a)(2)(ii)(F). LED string lights preferred (cooler, energy efficient, longer life).
- **Emergency/exit lighting** — Required in enclosed spaces, stairwells, below-grade areas. Battery-backed exit signs and emergency lights per local fire code.
- **Task lighting** — Portable lights for detailed work areas. GFCI-protected, guarded bulbs.
- **Exterior lighting** — Security lighting at entrances, material storage, parking. Timer or photocell-controlled.

## 2. TEMPORARY WATER

### Supply Connection
- **Metered tap from utility** — Apply to water utility during permitting. Lead time: 2-6 weeks depending on jurisdiction.
- **Backflow preventer REQUIRED** — Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) assembly on construction water supply per local plumbing code. Prevents contamination of public water supply.
- **Minimum 2-inch line** — For construction water (concrete curing, washdown, dust control). 1-inch adequate for office/restroom only.
- **Meter reading** — Record monthly for cost tracking and leak detection. Unexpected high usage = possible leak.

### Distribution
- **Pipe material:** PEX or polyethylene pipe for temporary above-grade. HDPE for buried runs.
- **Warm weather:** Above-grade distribution acceptable. Support pipe above traffic with stands or wire hangers.
- **Cold weather:** Below frost line (check local frost depth) OR heat-traced and insulated if above grade. Freeze damage destroys temporary water systems overnight.
- **Hose bibs:** Every 200-300 feet along distribution, at each floor level during multi-story construction, at concrete placement areas, at washout stations.
- **Shut-off valves:** At main connection, at each branch, at each floor takeoff. Label clearly. All personnel should know shut-off locations.

### Standpipe/Fire Protection During Construction
- **NFPA 241** — Standard for Safeguarding Construction, Alteration, and Demolition Operations
- **Temporary standpipes** may be required during construction per local fire code — typically when building exceeds one story above lowest fire department access
- **Requirements:** Minimum 4-inch standpipe, 2-1/2" hose connections at each floor, fire department connection (FDC) at grade, minimum 500 GPM at 100 PSI at highest outlet
- **Coordination:** Notify fire department of standpipe availability and building access during construction
- **Testing:** Hydrostatic test before use, flow test annually or per local AHJ requirements

### Washout Stations
- **Concrete washout** — Designated areas for concrete truck washout, pump washout, and tool cleaning
- **Construction:** Lined pit (6-mil poly minimum) with berms, or prefabricated steel washout containers
- **Size:** Minimum 10'x10' for truck washout, 4'x4' for pump/tool washout
- **Location:** Convenient to work areas but away from storm drains, waterways, and property lines
- **Maintenance:** Pump out and dispose of solidified concrete regularly. Do not allow overflow.
- **SWPPP compliance:** Washout stations are BMPs — maintain, inspect weekly and after rain events, document on SWPPP inspection reports
- **Multiple locations** — On large sites, provide one washout station per active concrete placement area to encourage use

### Potable Water for Workers (OSHA 1926.51)
- **Required:** Potable water must be available at all times for drinking
- **Containers:** Portable water coolers with single-use cups, or bottled water
- **Separate from construction water** — Clearly labeled "DRINKING WATER"
- **Location:** Within reasonable distance of all work areas (access without crossing hazards)
- **Temperature:** Cool water provided. In hot weather, plan for increased consumption (1 quart per worker per hour in heat)
- **Maintenance:** Clean and refill coolers daily, discard cups after use

## 3. TEMPORARY HEATING

### When Temporary Heating Is Required

| Activity | Minimum Temperature | Duration |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Concrete curing | 50degF | 72 hours minimum (or per mix design) |
| Concrete placement | 50degF | During placement and finishing |
| Drywall finishing (taping/mudding) | 50degF | During application and for 48 hours after |
| Painting (latex) | 50degF | During application and for 48 hours after |
| Painting (oil-based) | 45degF | During application and for 48 hours after |
| VCT flooring installation | 65-70degF | 48 hours before, during, and 48 hours after |
| Carpet installation | 65degF | 24 hours before and during |
| Epoxy flooring | 55-90degF | Per manufacturer — check data sheet |
| Worker comfort in enclosed spaces | 50degF minimum | Occupied hours |

### Heater Types Comparison

| Heater Type | BTU Range | Fuel | Indoor Safe? | Moisture Output | Cost |
|-------------|-----------|------|-------------|----------------|------|
| Direct-fired propane (torpedo) | 50K-400K | Propane | NO — produces CO and moisture | High | Low |
| Indirect-fired propane | 100K-1M | Propane/diesel | YES — ducted, vented | None (combustion exhausted) | Medium |
| Electric (portable) | 5K-50K | Electric | YES | None | High operating cost |
| Electric (unit heater) | 10K-100K | Electric | YES | None | High operating cost |
| Hydronic (ground heater) | 200K-1M+ | Diesel | YES (heat exchanger) | None | High rental cost |

### Direct-Fired Heaters (Torpedo/Salamander)
- **NEVER use in enclosed, unventilated spaces** — Produces carbon monoxide (CO) and moisture
- **Acceptable uses:** Open structures, parking garages, large warehouse spaces with natural ventilation
- **Ventilation requirement:** Minimum 4 air changes per hour (ACH) in the heated space
- **CO monitoring:** REQUIRED in any space heated with fossil fuel. Alarm at 35 PPM. Evacuate at 200 PPM (NIOSH ceiling).
- **Moisture:** Direct-fired propane produces approximately 1.5 gallons of water per gallon of propane burned. This moisture can damage finishes, prevent paint/drywall curing, and create condensation problems.

### Indirect-Fired Heaters
- **Safe for enclosed spaces** — Combustion occurs in sealed chamber, exhaust is ducted outside
- **Ducted heat distribution** — Flexible duct runs up to 100 feet from unit. Multiple duct runs possible.
- **Best for:** Interior finish work, concrete curing in enclosed buildings, any space requiring dry heat
- **Fuel consumption:** Higher than direct-fired for equivalent BTU output (less efficient)
- **Placement:** Unit outside building or at opening. Intake duct draws outside air, heats it, delivers inside. Exhaust vented to exterior.

### Electric Heaters
- **Safest for enclosed spaces** — No combustion, no CO, no moisture
- **Limitation:** Limited BTU output for large spaces. A 240V, 30-amp circuit produces approximately 17,000 BTU — one torpedo heater produces 10-20x more.
- **Best for:** Small rooms, offices, stairwells, elevator shafts, finish work areas
- **Cost:** High electrical operating cost. At $0.12/kWh, a 15kW heater costs approximately $1.80/hour to operate.

### Hydronic Ground Heaters
- **Large-scale concrete curing and ground thaw** — Circulates heated glycol through hoses laid on/under surfaces
- **Applications:** Slab-on-grade curing, frost prevention, ground thaw before excavation, bridge deck curing
- **Capacity:** 200,000-1,000,000+ BTU, heats 5,000-20,000+ SF per unit
- **Rental cost:** $2,000-$8,000/week depending on size and duration
- **Setup:** Diesel-fired boiler unit, glycol hoses on 6-12" spacing, insulating blankets over hoses

### Fuel Safety
- **Propane storage:** Cylinders stored upright, secured from tipping, 20 feet from ignition sources, 20 feet from building openings (NFPA 58)
- **Propane quantity limits:** Check local fire code — typically 500 lbs aggregate on-site without special permit
- **Diesel fuel:** Day tanks on equipment, bulk storage in double-walled tanks, secondary containment, 20 feet from buildings (NFPA 30)
- **Refueling:** Engine off, no smoking within 25 feet, fire extinguisher within 50 feet, spill kit available
- **Documentation:** Fuel delivery logs, storage quantities, safety data sheets (SDS) on-site

### Carbon Monoxide Monitoring — CRITICAL
- **Detector required in ALL enclosed heated spaces** where fossil-fuel heaters are used
- **Alarm set points:**
  - 35 PPM — OSHA 8-hour TWA. Investigate source, increase ventilation.
  - 100 PPM — NIOSH short-term limit. Begin evacuation, increase ventilation aggressively.
  - 200 PPM — NIOSH ceiling. EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY. Do not re-enter until below 35 PPM.
- **Detector placement:** At breathing height (4-6 feet), in occupied areas, away from heater exhaust
- **Calibration:** Per manufacturer schedule, typically monthly. Replace sensors per manufacturer life cycle (2-5 years).
- **Multiple detectors:** One per heated zone, minimum. One is not enough for a large building.

## 4. WINTER PROTECTION

### Temporary Enclosures
- **Frame material:** Scaffold framing, wood stud framing, or steel tube framing
- **Covering:** Polyethylene sheeting — 6-mil minimum for walls, 10-mil for roofs/wind-exposed areas. Reinforced poly preferred (woven, fiber-reinforced).
- **Attachment:** Stapled or clipped to framing, lapped and taped at seams (minimum 6-inch overlap)
- **Access points:** Closable openings with weighted flap doors or zippered entries. Minimize opening size to reduce heat loss.
- **Temperature maintenance:** With enclosure and properly sized heater, maintain 50-70degF inside even at sub-zero exterior temps
- **Wind resistance:** Enclosure framing must resist wind loads. Secure sheeting to prevent tearing. In high-wind areas, use scaffold mesh or fabric instead of poly.

### Ground Thaw
- **Hydronic ground heaters** — Most effective method. Hoses on ground surface with insulating blankets, 24-48 hours for 2-3 feet of frost.
- **Insulating blankets** — Straw, hay bales, or insulated concrete blankets placed before freeze to prevent frost. Works for prevention, not remediation.
- **Ground thaw depth requirement:** Minimum 24 inches below footing bottom in most jurisdictions (check local building code). Some require thaw to native unfrozen soil.
- **Verification:** Probe with steel rod or hand-auger to confirm thaw depth. Do NOT rely on surface conditions.
- **Duration:** Plan 24-72 hours for ground thaw depending on frost depth, soil type, and heater capacity

### Concrete Blankets and Curing Protection
- **Insulated tarps** — Multi-layer: vapor barrier + insulation + weatherproof cover. R-value 4-12 depending on product.
- **Maintain concrete above 50degF for minimum 72 hours** — Or per mix design/structural engineer requirements. High-early-strength mixes may require less time; mass concrete or structural elements may require more.
- **Extend blankets 2-4 feet beyond slab edges** — Heat loss is greatest at edges and corners
- **Monitor temperature:** Place temperature probes under blankets at center and edges. Log temperatures every 4 hours minimum.
- **Temperature differential:** Do not allow more than 35degF temperature differential between interior and exterior of concrete (thermal cracking risk in mass pours)
- **Blanket removal:** Gradual removal preferred — remove in sections, not all at once, to avoid thermal shock

### Pipe Freeze Prevention
- **Heat trace on all exposed temporary water lines** — Self-regulating heat trace preferred (adjusts output to temperature)
- **Insulate all temporary water** — Minimum 1-inch pipe insulation on all above-grade water lines
- **Drain lines when not in use** — Overnight and weekends. Open lowest valve, open all hose bibs.
- **Know shut-off locations** — Every superintendent and foreman should know where to shut off temporary water in an emergency
- **Hose bibs:** Frost-free type preferred. If not, disconnect hoses at end of each day to allow drainage.
- **Monitor weather forecast** — When overnight lows will drop below 28degF, activate freeze protection plan

### Snow Management
- **Daily access maintenance** — Clear roads, parking, walkways, and crane paths before start of work. Budget for snow removal equipment.
- **Roof load monitoring:**

| Snow Type | Weight (PSF per foot of depth) |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Fresh/dry snow | 5-10 PSF per foot |
| Settled/packed snow | 10-15 PSF per foot |
| Wet/heavy snow | 12-20 PSF per foot |
| Ice | 57 PSF per foot |
| Rain on snow | Adds 5.2 PSF per inch of rain |

- **Formwork/scaffold load monitoring** — Snow accumulation adds dead load not accounted for in shoring/scaffold design. Remove snow from forms and scaffolds before it accumulates.
- **Designated snow staging areas** — Identify where plowed/shoveled snow will be stockpiled. Away from building, roads, drainage. Plan for melt-water drainage.
- **Temporary roof structures** — When possible, install temporary roofing (metal deck, plywood + membrane) to allow interior trades to work weather-protected

---

## 5. TEMPORARY COOLING

### Evaporative Coolers (Swamp Coolers)
- **Effective in dry climates** — Below 40% relative humidity. Above 50% RH, minimal cooling effect.
- **Cooling capacity:** 15-25degF temperature drop in ideal (low humidity) conditions
- **Water supply required** — 3-10 gallons per hour per unit depending on size
- **Portable units:** 1,500-10,000 CFM units available for rental. One 5,000 CFM unit covers approximately 1,500 SF.
- **Limitations:** Adds humidity to space (not suitable for finish work requiring low humidity), requires open exhaust (cannot be used in sealed spaces)

### Shade Structures
- **Over outdoor work areas** — Canopy tents, shade sails, or temporary roofing for exposed workers
- **Rest stations** — Per heat illness prevention program: shaded area with seating, water, within 200 feet of work areas
- **Size:** Minimum 20 SF per worker at rest station
- **Open sides:** Allow air circulation, do not create enclosed hot space

### Ventilation Fans
- **High-volume low-speed (HVLS) fans** — 8-24-foot diameter ceiling fans, cover 10,000-20,000 SF per fan, effective for large open spaces (warehouses, parking structures)
- **Portable drum fans** — 24-48-inch diameter, 5,000-20,000 CFM, directional cooling for specific work areas
- **Air movement:** 3-5 mph air speed over workers provides 5-10degF perceived cooling (wind chill effect)
- **Dust control:** Fans can spread dust — coordinate with dust control measures, do not use near active silica/lead/asbestos operations without engineering controls

### Heat Illness Prevention
**OSHA and Cal-OSHA Requirements — the superintendent is responsible for implementation.**

- **Water:** Provide at least 1 quart per worker per hour in heat. Cool (below 77degF) potable water. Workers must drink before feeling thirsty.
- **Rest:** Mandatory rest breaks in shade when heat index exceeds 80degF. Duration and frequency increase with heat index.
- **Shade:** Available at all times for workers who need it. Mandatory during rest breaks.

**Acclimatization schedule for new workers (first 4 days on site):**

| Day | Maximum Exposure to Full Workload |
|-----|----------------------------------|
| Day 1 | 20% of normal workload/duration |
| Day 2 | 40% of normal workload/duration |
| Day 3 | 60% of normal workload/duration |
| Day 4 | 80% of normal workload/duration |
| Day 5+ | Full workload with monitoring |

- **Buddy system above 100degF heat index** — No one works alone. Partners watch for heat illness symptoms.
- **Symptoms to watch for:**
  - Heat cramps — muscle cramps, heavy sweating (move to shade, water, rest)
  - Heat exhaustion — heavy sweating, weakness, nausea, dizziness, cool/clammy skin (stop work, cool down, hydrate, monitor)
  - Heat stroke — hot/dry skin, confusion, loss of consciousness (CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY, cool aggressively, this is a medical emergency)
- **Emergency plan:** Ice, cooling towels/vests on-site. Know hospital route. Have someone designated to call 911 at all times.

## 6. DEWATERING SYSTEMS

### System Types Comparison

| System | Drawdown Depth | Flow Rate | Soil Type | Cost | Complexity |
|--------|---------------|-----------|-----------|------|------------|
| Sump pump | Surface water only | 50-500 GPM | Any | Low | Simple |
| Wellpoint | Up to 15-18 feet | 500-5,000 GPM | Sand, gravel | Medium | Moderate |
| Deep well | 50+ feet | 100-1,000 GPM per well | Sand, gravel, rock | High | Requires hydrogeologist |
| Eductor well | Up to 25 feet | 10-100 GPM per well | Silt, clay, fine sand | High | Requires specialist |

### Sump Pumps
- **Simplest system** — Excavate sump pit in lowest point of excavation, install submersible pump
- **Best for:** Minor groundwater seepage, rainwater accumulation, nuisance water
- **Sump pit:** Minimum 3'x3'x3', lined with gravel, perforated pipe optional for collection
- **Pump sizing:** Match to inflow rate. Start with 2-4" submersible trash pump (50-200 GPM).
- **Limitations:** Cannot lower water table — only removes water that enters excavation. If inflow exceeds pump capacity, excavation floods.

### Wellpoint Systems
- **Perimeter dewatering** — Series of small-diameter wells (wellpoints) connected to header pipe and vacuum pump
- **Installation:** Drive or jet wellpoints at 3-6 foot spacing around excavation perimeter
- **Header pipe:** 6-12 inch diameter, connected to vacuum pump
- **Drawdown:** Maximum 15-18 feet per stage (limited by atmospheric pressure/vacuum). For deeper, use multi-stage (upper stage + lower stage).
- **Best for:** Sandy/gravelly soils, sheet-pile-enclosed excavations, linear excavations (trenches)
- **Runtime:** 24/7 during excavation. CANNOT be shut down or excavation floods.

### Deep Wells
- **Individual drilled wells with submersible pumps** — Lower water table from depth
- **Well diameter:** 6-12 inches, screened in water-bearing zone
- **Spacing:** 20-100 feet depending on soil permeability and required drawdown
- **Drawdown:** 50+ feet possible with properly designed system
- **Design:** Requires hydrogeologist — soil borings, permeability testing, aquifer analysis, drawdown modeling
- **Permits:** May require state/local groundwater withdrawal permit. Lead time 4-12 weeks.

### Eductor Wells
- **For fine-grained soils where wellpoints fail** — Uses high-pressure water recirculation to create vacuum
- **How it works:** High-pressure supply water creates venturi effect at well bottom, draws groundwater up and out
- **Best for:** Silt, clay, fine sand — soils too fine for conventional wellpoint vacuum
- **Drawdown:** Up to 25 feet in fine soils
- **Specialist system:** Requires dewatering contractor with eductor experience

### Selection Factors

| Factor | Consider |
|--------|----------|
| Soil type | Sand/gravel = wellpoints or deep wells. Silt/clay = eductors or deep wells. |
| Required drawdown | <15' = wellpoints. 15-25' = eductors or deep wells. >25' = deep wells. |
| Duration | Short-term (<30 days) = sump pumps or rented wellpoints. Long-term = deep wells. |
| Site access | Wellpoints need perimeter access. Deep wells need drill rig access. |
| Discharge volume | High flow = settling capacity needed. Permitting may limit discharge. |

### Discharge Compliance
- **NPDES permit or local discharge permit** — Required for most construction dewatering discharge. Apply during permitting phase.
- **Sediment removal:** Water must be treated before discharge. Options:
  - Settling tank (Baker tank) — Gravity settling, minimum 10-minute retention time
  - Filter bags (dewatering bags) — Geotextile bags, effective for silt/clay
  - Sediment trap — Excavated pit with weir and baffles
- **Turbidity monitoring:** Measure discharge turbidity with meter. Most permits limit to 50-250 NTU depending on receiving water.
- **Discharge point:** Approved location — typically storm drain (with permit) or vegetated area with erosion protection. NEVER discharge directly to waterway without permit.
- **pH monitoring:** Concrete contact or limestone soils can raise pH above permit limits (typically 6.5-9.0). Test and treat if needed.

### Maintenance and Monitoring
- **Pump monitoring:** Check flow rate, discharge pressure, and power consumption daily. Changes indicate clogging, pump wear, or water table changes.
- **Backup pump:** On standby for every active pump. Sized to match primary. Connected for quick changeover.
- **24-hour operation:** During critical excavation phases, dewatering runs continuously. Assign night monitoring or remote alarm system.
- **Fuel supply:** Generator-powered pumps need reliable fuel supply. Maintain minimum 48-hour fuel reserve. Coordinate weekend/holiday fuel delivery.
- **Water level monitoring:** Install observation wells (piezometers) to verify drawdown achieving design levels. Check daily.

## 7. TEMPORARY ENCLOSURES

### Dust Barriers
- **Polyethylene sheeting** — 6-mil minimum for dust containment, fire-retardant poly preferred
- **Framing:** Build stud walls or use ZipWall-type poles for floor-to-ceiling barriers
- **Seal all edges** — Tape to floor, ceiling, and adjacent walls. Overlap seams 12 inches minimum, tape full length.
- **Negative air pressure** — For interior demolition/renovation, maintain negative pressure inside containment (air flows IN through gaps, dust stays inside). Use HEPA-filtered negative air machines.
- **Airlock entry** — Double flap or zippered door entry. Workers enter through first flap, close it, then open second flap. Prevents pressure break.

### ICRA (Infection Control Risk Assessment) — Healthcare Projects
| ICRA Class | Activity | Requirements |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Class I | Minor, low-dust work | Work methods to minimize dust, seal unused openings |
| Class II | Small-scale, short-duration | Poly barriers, mist/HEPA vacuum, seal connections to adjacent areas |
| Class III | Large-scale, generates significant dust | Hard wall barriers, negative pressure, HEPA filtration, anteroom entry |
| Class IV | Major demolition/construction in patient areas | Full containment, negative pressure with continuous monitoring, HEPA, sealed barriers, traffic plan |

### Weather Protection
- **Scaffold shrink-wrap** — Heat-shrink polyethylene film applied to scaffold framing for winter exterior work. Allows scaffolding to remain usable in rain/snow/wind. Fire-retardant grade required.
- **Temporary roofing** — Metal deck, plywood + membrane, or tensioned fabric installed over open structure to allow interior trades to work weather-protected. Structural engineer must verify temporary loads on permanent structure.
- **Building wrap** — Tyvek or equivalent on open structures to reduce wind/rain infiltration while envelope is incomplete. Allows interior work to proceed.
- **Tarps and poly** — Short-term coverage for open floors, material protection, curing protection. Secure against wind (sandbags, clamps, tape — not just gravity).

### Noise Barriers
- **Sound curtains/blankets** — Quilted vinyl or loaded vinyl barriers hung from supports around noise source
- **STC rating:** 25-30 typical for construction sound blankets
- **Noise reduction:** 10-15 dB at receptor location (significant — every 10 dB reduction sounds roughly half as loud)
- **Applications:** Pile driving, concrete breaking/sawcutting, jackhammering, generator enclosures
- **Installation:** Overlap panels 6 inches, seal at bottom (weight bar or sand tube), extend above noise source by 2-4 feet minimum
- **Coordination:** Verify local noise ordinance limits (typically 60-80 dB at property line, lower evenings/weekends/residential). Adjust work hours and mitigation accordingly.

### Dust Mitigation
- **Water trucks** — For haul roads and unpaved traffic areas. Apply water to maintain visible dampness (3-4 applications per day typical, more in hot/windy conditions).
- **BMP entrance stabilization** — Stabilized construction entrance (6-inch minimum crushed stone, 50-foot minimum length, 12-foot minimum width) per SWPPP. Rumble strips or tire wash for extreme tracking conditions.
- **Covering stockpiles** — Soil and aggregate stockpiles not actively being used must be covered (poly, anchored tarps) or treated (tackifier, hydromulch) per SWPPP.
- **Misting systems** — Fixed or portable misting fans at demolition/concrete operations, crushing/screening, and material transfer points. Reduces airborne particulate 70-90%.
- **Silica dust** — OSHA Table 1 controls for concrete cutting/grinding: wet methods preferred, local exhaust ventilation (vacuum shroud) on grinders/saws, respirators as last resort. Action level 25 ug/m3, PEL 50 ug/m3.
