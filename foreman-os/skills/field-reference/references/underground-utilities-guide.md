## 1. UTILITY TYPES OVERVIEW

### Common Underground Utility Systems

| Utility | Typical Materials | Depth of Cover | Pressure/Gravity | Key Standard |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Domestic Water** | DIP, PVC (C900), HDPE | Below frost line (3-6' typical) | Pressure (40-80 PSI typical) | AWWA C600/C605 |
| **Fire Water** | DIP (most common), PVC (C900) | Below frost line (3-6' typical) | Pressure (150+ PSI test) | NFPA 24, AWWA |
| **Sanitary Sewer** | PVC (SDR 26/35), DIP, HDPE | 4-20'+ (gravity flow) | Gravity (0.5-2% slope typical) | ASTM D3034/D2321 |
| **Storm Sewer** | RCP, corrugated HDPE, PVC, CMP | 2-8' (varies by design) | Gravity | ASTM C76, AASHTO |
| **Natural Gas** | PE (polyethylene), steel (coated) | 18-36" cover (varies by jurisdiction) | Pressure (low/medium/high) | 49 CFR 192 |
| **Electrical** | PVC conduit (Sch 40/80), direct-bury cable | 24-36" cover (NEC Table 300.5) | N/A | NEC Article 300 |
| **Telecommunications** | PVC conduit, direct-bury cable, innerduct | 24-36" cover | N/A | ANSI/TIA-758 |
| **Fiber Optic** | HDPE innerduct in PVC conduit | 24-36" cover | N/A | ANSI/TIA-758 |

## 2. TRENCH DIMENSIONS

### Width Requirements

| Pipe Diameter | Minimum Trench Width | Notes |
|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| Up to 12" OD | Pipe OD + 24" (12" each side) | Minimum working space for bedding and compaction |
| 12-24" OD | Pipe OD + 24" (12" each side) | More space may be needed for joint assembly |
| 24-48" OD | Pipe OD + 30" (15" each side) | Worker access for inspection and joint work |
| Over 48" OD | Pipe OD + 36" (18" each side) | Full worker entry required for joint assembly |

**Minimum trench width regardless of pipe size: 24 inches** — enough for compaction equipment access.

**Maximum trench width:** Keep as narrow as practical — wider trench = more backfill = more settlement risk. Trench wider than 3x pipe OD requires special bedding design.

### Depth Requirements

| Utility | Minimum Cover | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Water main** | Below frost line + 6" (3.5-6' typical in northern US, 2-3' in southern US) | Check local code — frost depth varies dramatically by region |
| **Fire line** | Same as water main | Must be below frost line to prevent freezing |
| **Sanitary sewer** | Gravity dictates (4-20'+) | Slope drives depth; inverts designed by engineer |
| **Storm sewer** | 2-4' minimum cover (traffic areas) | Less critical — freezing doesn't permanently damage |
| **Gas (low pressure)** | 18" minimum (24" under roads) | Check local gas company requirements |
| **Gas (high pressure)** | 36" minimum | More restrictive jurisdictional requirements |
| **Electrical (direct bury)** | 24" (residential), 30-36" (commercial) | NEC Table 300.5; deeper under roads |
| **Telecom/Fiber** | 24" minimum (30-36" under roads) | Verify with utility owner |

## 3. BEDDING AND BACKFILL (ASTM D2321)

### Bedding Material Classes

| Class | Material Description | Suitability | Use |
|-------|---------------------|-------------|-----|
| **Class I** | Angular crushed stone, 1/4"-1-1/2" | Excellent — best pipe support | All pipe types; critical installations; rocky or wet trench bottoms |
| **Class II** | Coarse sand, gravel, crushed gravel (GW, GP, SW, SP) | Good — most common for utility work | Standard bedding for most installations |
| **Class III** | Fine sand, sandy silt, clayey sand (GM, GC, SM, SC) | Acceptable — needs compaction | OK for bedding if compacted to 90%+; needs moisture control |
| **Class IV** | Silty clay, low-plasticity clay (ML, CL) | Marginal — only with compaction | Acceptable for backfill above pipe zone only; NOT recommended for bedding |
| **Class V** | Organic soil, peat, debris, frozen soil, mud | NEVER use | Prohibited as bedding or pipe zone backfill — remove and replace |

### Bedding Configuration

**Standard Trench Cross-Section (bottom to top):**

1. **Trench bottom preparation**
   - Remove rocks, debris, and sharp objects
   - If rock bottom: over-excavate 6" below pipe and backfill with Class I or II bedding
   - If soft bottom: stabilize with geotextile fabric + Class I stone

2. **Bedding layer**
   - **Depth: 4-6 inches minimum** below bottom of pipe (6" preferred for pipes >12" diameter)
   - Class I or II material
   - Level and grade to pipe design elevation and slope
   - **Do NOT compact bedding under pipe barrel** — pipe should seat into bedding naturally

3. **Haunching**
   - Material placed and compacted from bedding level to **pipe springline** (widest point of pipe)
   - **Most critical compaction zone** — supports the pipe and prevents deflection
   - Hand-tamp or mechanical tamper in 6" lifts
   - Work material under pipe haunches — do NOT leave voids
   - **Minimum 90% Standard Proctor** (85% if using Class I angular stone — self-compacting)

4. **Initial backfill**
   - From springline to **12 inches above pipe crown**
   - Class I, II, or III material
   - Compact in 6" lifts to 90% Standard Proctor minimum
   - **No mechanical compaction directly on top of pipe** for flexible pipe (PVC, HDPE) until 12" of cover — use hand tamper

5. **Final backfill**
   - From 12" above crown to finish grade
   - Class II, III, or IV acceptable (depending on surface use)
   - **Under pavement/structures:** Compact to 95% Modified Proctor in 8" lifts
   - **Under landscaping:** Compact to 90% Standard Proctor in 12" lifts
   - **No rocks larger than 3"** in final backfill within 2 feet of pipe

## 4. PIPE MATERIALS

### Selection Table

| Material | Abbreviation | Typical Use | Joints | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Ductile Iron Pipe** | DIP | Water mains, fire lines | Push-on (Tyton), MJ (mechanical), flanged | High strength, long life (75-100 yr), fire resistant | Heavy, corrosion in aggressive soils, expensive |
| **PVC (C900/C905)** | PVC-C900 | Water main, fire line | Push-on with gasket | Lightweight, corrosion-free, smooth interior | Brittle in cold, UV sensitive, limited to 12" typical |
| **PVC (SDR 26/35)** | PVC-SDR | Sanitary sewer, storm | Push-on with gasket | Lightweight, smooth, chemical resistant | Flexible — needs proper bedding support |
| **PVC (Schedule 40/80)** | PVC-Sch | Conduit, pressure pipe, force main | Solvent weld or threaded | Available everywhere, easy to work | Less flexible than SDR; Sch 40 not for burial without protection |
| **HDPE (High-Density PE)** | HDPE | Force mains, directional boring, gas | Butt fusion, electrofusion | Flexible, zero-leak joints, corrosion-free, ideal for trenchless | Requires fusion equipment, higher expansion/contraction |
| **Reinforced Concrete Pipe** | RCP | Large storm sewers (12-144") | Bell-and-spigot with gasket, tongue-and-groove | Very high strength, long life, large sizes | Very heavy (crane required), expensive to transport |
| **Corrugated Metal Pipe** | CMP | Storm drainage, culverts | Band coupling | Economical, fast installation | Limited life in corrosive soils (15-50 years), rougher interior |
| **Corrugated HDPE** | CHDPE | Storm drainage, detention | Gasketed bell, coupling bands | Lightweight, smooth interior (dual wall), easy to handle | Requires careful bedding — very flexible pipe |

### Pipe Stiffness and Flexibility

**Rigid pipe** (RCP, DIP, vitrified clay): Transfers load to bedding through pipe structure. Less dependent on side support but heavy.

**Flexible pipe** (PVC, HDPE, CMP, CHDPE): Deflects under load and transfers load to surrounding soil. **Absolutely dependent on proper bedding and compaction** — poor bedding = excessive deflection = failure.

**Critical Rule for Flexible Pipe:**
- Maximum allowable deflection: **5%** of pipe inside diameter
- At 5% deflection, pipe is approaching structural distress
- At 7.5%+ deflection, pipe has failed — must be removed and replaced
- Proper bedding and compaction prevent deflection

## 5. PRESSURE TESTING

### Water/Fire Line Hydrostatic Test

**Standard Procedure (AWWA C600/C605):**

1. **Fill line slowly** — flush air from all high points through air release valves or hydrants
2. **Let stand 24 hours minimum** before testing (allows pipe to absorb water and stabilize)
3. **Test pressure:** **150% of working pressure** or **200 PSI**, whichever is greater
   - Typical municipal water: working pressure 60-80 PSI; test at 200 PSI
   - Fire line: working pressure varies; test at 200 PSI minimum (NFPA 24)
4. **Hold time:** **2 hours minimum** at test pressure
5. **Allowable leakage:** Per AWWA formula — depends on pipe diameter, length, and pressure
   - Rule of thumb: ≤10 gallons per inch of diameter per mile per 24 hours at test pressure
   - Many specs require ZERO leakage (no visible drop in pressure)
6. **Pump to maintain pressure** — record water added to maintain test pressure; this is the leakage rate
7. **Pass/fail:** Compare measured leakage to allowable leakage; no visible leaks at joints

**Field Tips:**
- Test before backfill if possible — visible leak detection
- Ensure all thrust restraint is in place before pressurizing
- Cap all open ends with restrained plugs/caps
- Temperature changes affect pressure (thermal expansion) — test early morning for stable temps
- **Do NOT stand over pressurized plugs or caps** — they can blow off with lethal force

### Sanitary Sewer Testing

**Air Test (Low-Pressure Air Test):**
1. Plug all openings in test section
2. Pressurize to **3.5 PSI** (above ambient groundwater if present)
3. Allow pressure to stabilize for 2 minutes
4. **Time the pressure drop** from 3.5 PSI to 2.5 PSI
5. Minimum hold time varies by pipe diameter:
   - 4" pipe: 1.5 minutes minimum
   - 6" pipe: 2.0 minutes
   - 8" pipe: 2.5 minutes
   - 10" pipe: 3.0 minutes
   - 12" pipe: 3.5 minutes
   - 15" pipe: 4.5 minutes
6. **Pass:** Pressure does not drop from 3.5 to 2.5 PSI within the minimum time

**Mandrel Test (Deflection Test for Flexible Pipe):**
1. Pull a rigid mandrel (go/no-go gauge) through installed pipe
2. **Mandrel diameter = 95% of pipe base inside diameter**
3. If mandrel passes through entire section: **PASS** (deflection is <5%)
4. If mandrel will not pass: **FAIL** — pipe must be excavated, re-bedded, and retested
5. Test minimum **30 days after backfill** (allows initial deflection to occur)

**Vacuum Test (Manholes):**
1. Seal all pipes entering manhole with inflatable plugs
2. Place vacuum test head on frame opening
3. Draw vacuum to **10 inches of mercury (10" Hg)**
4. Hold for time based on manhole diameter (typically 60-120 seconds)
5. **Pass:** Vacuum does not drop below 9" Hg within hold time

## 6. UTILITY CROSSING AND SEPARATION

### Minimum Horizontal Separation Requirements

| Utility A | Utility B | Minimum Horizontal Separation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **Water main** | **Sanitary sewer** | **10 feet** (per Ten States Standards) |
| **Water main** | **Storm sewer** | 10 feet (recommended) |
| **Water main** | **Gas main** | 3-5 feet (varies by jurisdiction) |
| **Water main** | **Electrical** | 3-5 feet |
| **Sanitary sewer** | **Storm sewer** | 5 feet (recommended) |
| **Gas main** | **Electrical** | 12 inches minimum (varies) |
| **Gas main** | **Telecom** | 12 inches minimum |
| **Electrical** | **Telecom** | 12 inches minimum |

### Vertical Crossing Requirements (Water Over Sewer)

**When water and sewer MUST cross (less than 10 feet horizontal separation):**
- **Water line must be ON TOP** — minimum 18 inches of vertical clearance between outside surfaces
- **If water is below sewer:** Special construction required — water line in steel casing or ductile iron for 10 feet each side of crossing
- **Joint restrictions:** No water line joints within 10 feet of sewer crossing; no sewer joints within 10 feet of water crossing
- **Concrete encasement:** Some jurisdictions require concrete encasement of the lower utility at crossings

### Crossing Construction

- **Rigid pipe sleeve:** Install casing pipe (steel or PVC) at crossings where required
- **Concrete encasement:** 6" minimum concrete around pipe at crossing — reinforced if beneath road
- **Support:** Carrier pipe must be supported on spacers within casing — no pipe-on-pipe contact
- **Seal casing ends** with link seals or mechanical end seals to prevent groundwater migration through casing

---

## 7. THRUST RESTRAINT

### Where Needed

Thrust forces occur at every change in direction, dead end, or size change on pressure piping:
- **Bends (elbows):** 11.25°, 22.5°, 45°, 90° — force increases with angle
- **Tees:** Thrust at branch and both run directions
- **Dead ends (caps, plugs):** Full line pressure on cap area
- **Reducers:** Differential force between large and small diameters
- **Valves:** When closed, full line pressure acts on valve disc

### Thrust Restraint Methods

| Method | Description | When Used |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Thrust blocks** | Concrete poured between fitting and undisturbed soil | Standard for DIP in open trench; requires bearing against solid ground |
| **Restrained joints** | MJ retainer glands (Megalug, etc.) or mechanical restrained joints | Where thrust blocks impractical: high water table, poor soils, close to structures |
| **Tie rods** | Steel rods clamped across joint | Small fittings, temporary restraint |
| **Fusion welded joints (HDPE)** | Each joint is fully restrained by fusion | Inherent restraint — no thrust blocks needed for fused HDPE |

### Thrust Block Rules

- **Size thrust blocks per engineer's design** — do NOT guess; block size depends on pressure, pipe size, soil bearing capacity, and fitting angle
- **Pour against UNDISTURBED soil** — if soil has been excavated behind the block location, the block has nothing to push against
- **Thrust block must bear against soil, not against backfill**
- **Allow concrete to cure before pressurizing** — 3 days minimum (7 days preferred)
- **Wrap fitting with poly before pouring** — allows future removal of fitting without destroying concrete

## 8. MANHOLES AND STRUCTURES

### Precast vs. Cast-in-Place

| Type | Advantages | Disadvantages | Best For |
|------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Precast concrete** | Fast installation, consistent quality, immediate backfill | Heavy (crane required), limited custom shapes | Standard sanitary/storm manholes, catch basins |
| **Cast-in-place** | Any shape, deep structures, heavy loading | Slow (forming, pouring, curing), variable quality | Unusual sizes, very deep, large junction chambers |

### Manhole Construction Checklist

1. **Excavation:** Oversize minimum 12" beyond manhole OD for backfill compaction access
2. **Base:** Minimum 6" compacted Class I or II bedding material
3. **Set base section:** Level within 1/4"; invert elevation per design ±1/4"
4. **Set riser sections:** Align vertically; joint sealant (butyl or other per spec) at all section joints
5. **Pipes:** Core-drill or use precast knock-outs; install flexible boot connection (A-Lok, Kor-N-Seal, or similar)
6. **Invert channels:** Form smooth channels at base to guide flow; bench sides at 1:12 slope minimum
7. **Grade adjustment:** Flat slab top or eccentric cone; grade rings to final elevation (maximum 12" of grade rings)
8. **Frame and cover:** Set to finish grade ±1/4"; verify cover type (traffic rated, non-traffic, locking, watertight)
9. **Steps:** Installed per spec; OSHA-compliant (alternating sides, corrosion-resistant) — some jurisdictions prohibit steps and require portable ladders
10. **Backfill:** Compact in 8" lifts to 95% Modified Proctor around structure

### Invert Elevations

- **Must match design within ±1/4"** — inverts control flow direction and velocity
- **Survey each invert** after pipe installation and before grouting boot connections
- **Upstream pipe invert must be HIGHER than downstream** — verify slope direction before backfill
- **Drop connections:** Install when invert difference exceeds 24" at a manhole — prevents erosion of manhole base

## 9. AS-BUILT DOCUMENTATION

### Required Information for Every Utility Run

| Data Point | Method | Accuracy Required |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Horizontal location** | GPS (sub-meter) or offset ties from 2+ permanent reference points | ±1 foot horizontal (±6" preferred) |
| **Invert elevations** | Survey (level/rod or total station) | ±0.01 foot (1/8") |
| **Depth of cover** | Measure from finish grade to top of pipe | ±3" |
| **Pipe material** | Visual identification, record from submittals | Exact |
| **Pipe size (diameter)** | Tape measure or caliper | Exact |
| **Pipe class/schedule** | From marking on pipe or submittals | Exact |
| **Joint type** | Visual (push-on, MJ, fusion, etc.) | Exact |
| **Valve/fitting locations** | GPS or offset ties | ±1 foot |
| **Manhole rim and invert** | Survey | ±0.01 foot |
| **Bend/fitting locations** | GPS or offset ties | ±1 foot |
| **Casing locations** | GPS or offset ties; record casing size and material | ±1 foot |

### Offset Tie Method

When GPS is not available, record location using **minimum 2 offset ties from permanent objects:**
- Measure horizontal distance from 2 permanent reference points (building corners, fire hydrants, power poles, survey monuments)
- Record reference point descriptions and distances
- Triangulation from 2 points establishes location
- **Permanent references only** — do NOT tie to fences, trees, or temporary objects

### Photo Documentation (Before Backfill)

**Required photos for every utility run:**
- [ ] Bedding material and depth (ruler in photo for scale)
- [ ] Pipe in trench — showing material, size, bedding, and alignment
- [ ] Each joint connection — verifiable that joint is properly made
- [ ] Each fitting (bends, tees, valves, reducers)
- [ ] Thrust blocks or restrained joints
- [ ] Pipe-to-structure connections (manhole boots, building entries)
- [ ] Casing installations and end seals
- [ ] Test setup (gauges, plugs)
- [ ] Stamped/marked distance along pipe for reference (paint marks at 25' or 50' intervals)

**Rule: If you can't prove it was built right, it might as well not have been built right. Photos are free. Excavation to verify is expensive.**

---

## 10. UTILITY LOCATE REQUIREMENTS

### Before You Dig

**811/One-Call Notification:**
- **Call 811 minimum 48-72 hours before any excavation** (varies by state — some require 72 hours, some allow 48)
- Provide: project address, type of work, area of excavation, planned start date
- **Utility owners have 48-72 hours to respond** with markings or clear notice
- **Do NOT dig until all utilities have responded** — even if some marks are in place, wait for all-clear from all utility owners

### APWA Uniform Color Code

| Color | Utility Type |
|-------|-------------|
| **Red** | Electric power, cables, conduit, lighting |
| **Yellow** | Gas, oil, steam, petroleum, gaseous materials |
| **Orange** | Telecommunications, alarm/signal, fiber optic |
| **Blue** | Water, irrigation, slurry lines |
| **Green** | Sewer, storm drain, drain lines |
| **Purple** | Reclaimed water, irrigation (non-potable) |
| **Pink** | Temporary survey marks |
| **White** | Proposed excavation (your marks showing dig area) |

### Tolerance Zone

- **Standard tolerance: ±24 inches** from the marked centerline (48" total zone) — varies by state
- **Within the tolerance zone: HAND-DIG ONLY** — no mechanical excavation
- **Potholing (test holes):** Dig carefully by hand or vacuum excavation to physically expose and verify utility location
- **If marks seem wrong:** STOP and call the utility owner for re-mark before proceeding
- **Unmarked utilities:** If you encounter an unmarked utility — STOP work, call 811, notify utility owners, mark and protect the utility

### Potholing Procedures

1. Mark pothole location based on utility locate marks
2. **Vacuum excavation (preferred):** Air or water vacuum system — safest method, no mechanical contact with utility
3. **Hand digging:** Careful shovel work — probe soil before digging; stop immediately if contact with hard object
4. **Expose utility completely** — verify material, size, depth, and condition
5. **Record:** GPS or offset ties, depth, pipe material, pipe size, condition
6. **Protect exposed utility** during construction — shore or support if spanning the pothole

## 11. GRAVITY SEWER SLOPE REQUIREMENTS

### Minimum Slopes (Typical Municipal Standards)

| Pipe Diameter | Minimum Slope (ft/ft) | Minimum Slope (%) | Velocity at Min Slope (fps) |
|---------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| 4" | 0.0208 | 2.08% | 2.0 fps |
| 6" | 0.0125 | 1.25% | 2.0 fps |
| 8" | 0.0083 | 0.83% | 2.0 fps |
| 10" | 0.0063 | 0.63% | 2.0 fps |
| 12" | 0.0050 | 0.50% | 2.0 fps |
| 15" | 0.0040 | 0.40% | 2.0 fps |
| 18" | 0.0033 | 0.33% | 2.0 fps |
| 24" | 0.0025 | 0.25% | 2.0 fps |

**Target: 2.0 feet per second minimum velocity** at design flow — self-cleaning velocity that prevents solids from settling in pipe.

**Maximum slope:** Typically 10-15% for sanitary sewer — steeper slopes cause scouring; use drop manholes for elevation changes.

### Field Slope Verification

- **Laser level in pipe:** Set laser at upstream invert; verify hits target at downstream invert
- **Grade rod and builder's level:** Shoot elevation at each end, calculate slope
- **Quick check:** For 8" sewer at 0.83% slope on a 100-foot run = 0.83 feet of fall (approximately 10 inches)

## 12. COMMON MISTAKES AND PREVENTION

### Installation Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **No bedding or inadequate bedding** | Pipe sits on rock/debris; point loading causes cracking or deflection | Always prepare bedding; inspect before laying pipe |
| **Rocks in pipe zone** | Puncture or point loading on pipe | Screen backfill material; hand-place in pipe zone |
| **Compacting directly on flexible pipe** | Excessive deflection, pipe failure | No mechanical compaction within 12" of pipe crown |
| **Insufficient slope for gravity lines** | Sewage/stormwater backs up, solids deposit | Laser-check slope before backfill; verify design grade |
| **Not testing before backfill** | Leaking joints buried — expensive to repair later | Test every section before covering |
| **Missing as-builts** | Utility cannot be located later; hits during future excavation | Survey and photograph EVERY utility before backfill |
| **Improper joint assembly** | Gasket rolls out of position; leaking joint | Train crew on proper joint technique; inspect each joint |
| **No thrust restraint at fittings** | Pressure blows fittings apart during testing or service | Install thrust blocks or restrained joints per design |
| **Over-excavating below pipe** | Soft spot under pipe; settlement after backfill | Excavate to design, not deeper; if over-excavated, fill with compacted Class I stone |
| **Backfill with native soil containing organics** | Settlement above utility, pavement failure | Use imported select fill in trench; reject native soil with organics |

### Testing Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Testing with air trapped in water line** | False readings — air compresses and masks leaks | Flush air at all high points; fill slowly from low end |
| **Inadequate thrust restraint during test** | Blow-off at cap or dead end | Verify all restraint in place before pressurizing |
| **Testing too soon after backfill (mandrel)** | Pipe may not have reached final deflection | Wait 30 days minimum for mandrel test |
| **Not documenting test results** | No proof of passing test; inspector rejects work | Record gauge readings, times, witnesses; photograph setup |

---

## 13. TRENCH SAFETY (OSHA 1926 SUBPART P)

### Depth Thresholds

| Trench Depth | OSHA Requirement |
|-------------|------------------|
| **<5 feet** | Protective system not required IF competent person evaluates and determines no hazard |
| **5-20 feet** | Protective system REQUIRED: sloping, benching, shoring, or trench box |
| **>20 feet** | Protective system must be designed by registered professional engineer |

### Protection Methods

- **Sloping:** Cut trench walls back at stable angle — 1.5:1 (horizontal:vertical) for Type C soil (most common default)
- **Benching:** Cut steps in trench wall — prohibited in Type C soil (only Type A and B)
- **Shoring:** Hydraulic, pneumatic, or timber shores pressing against trench walls
- **Trench box/shield:** Pre-fabricated box placed in trench — workers inside box only

### Competent Person (Trench)

- Must inspect trench at start of each shift, after rain, and after any event that could change conditions
- Authority to remove workers from trench immediately
- Must classify soil type (A, B, C, or stable rock) using manual tests (thumb penetration, pocket penetrometer, visual)
- **When in doubt, classify as Type C** — worst case; requires most conservative protection

### Basic Trench Safety Rules

- **Spoil pile minimum 2 feet back** from trench edge
- **Means of egress (ladder or ramp) every 25 feet** of trench travel distance
- **No heavy equipment operating adjacent to trench edge** without protection system rated for surcharge loading
- **Barricade open trenches** at end of shift — hard barricade, not just tape
- **Water accumulation:** Pump trench before worker entry; monitor continuously

---

## 14. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS

### Required for Each Utility Section

- **Design drawings:** Plan and profile with pipe sizes, materials, slopes, invert elevations
- **As-built drawings:** Actual installed locations overlaid on design (red-line markups minimum)
- **Material certifications:** Pipe, fittings, gaskets, bedding material
- **Compaction test results:** Bedding, pipe zone, and trench backfill
- **Pressure/leak test results:** Signed by inspector, with gauge photos and time records
- **Mandrel test results:** Pass/fail for each section with deflection data
- **Manhole vacuum test results:** Each manhole individually documented
- **CCTV inspection:** Video inspection of completed sewer lines before acceptance (commonly required by municipalities)
- **Bacteriological test (water):** Two consecutive passing samples before service connection
- **GPS/survey data:** Digital and hard-copy as-builts with coordinates and elevations
- **Photo log:** All critical stages documented before backfill
