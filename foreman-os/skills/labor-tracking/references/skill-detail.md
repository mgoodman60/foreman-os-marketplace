## 8. Integration Points

### 1. Daily Report Format
**Integration**: Labor crew counts from daily reports auto-populate crew summary forms. Labor entries cross-checked against crew counts to identify missing trades or discrepancies.

```
Daily Report → Crew Counts → Labor Entry Validation
                           ↓
                    Alert if mismatch
```

### 2. Cost Tracking / Earned Value Management (EVM)
**Integration**: Labor hours × burdened rate = Actual Cost (AC) for cost tracking. Productivity ratios feed into Earned Value (EV) calculations. Productivity variance impacts cost variance analysis.

```
Labor Entry (hours, rate) → Actual Cost (AC)
Labor Productivity Ratio → Earned Value (EV)
AC - EV = Cost Variance
```

### 3. Sub-Performance Scoring
**Integration**: Labor efficiency and productivity metrics feed into subcontractor performance scorecards. Weekly efficiency ratios track whether subs are meeting productivity benchmarks.

```
Weekly Labor Summary → Sub Performance Score
  • Efficiency Factor: 93.5% (Good)
  • On-Time Delivery: Yes
  • Quality Rating: Excellent
  → Overall Performance: 94/100 (Excellent)
```

### 4. Pay Application Support
**Integration**: T&M billing backed by detailed labor hour records. Labor summary provides actuals for progress payment invoices.

```
Labor Entries → Weekly Summary → Pay Application
  Supports: T&M invoices with labor detail backup
```

### 5. Look-Ahead Planner
**Integration**: Historical labor productivity ratios inform resource planning for upcoming work windows. Labor headcount trend helps plan crew mobilization.

```
Past Productivity: 3.04 LF/hour (concrete)
  ↓
Upcoming Footing (500 LF)
  = 164 labor-hours required
  = 1.5 weeks for 6-person crew
  → Schedule impact: May need 8-person crew
```

### 6. Project Dashboard
**Integration**: Weekly labor utilization charts, productivity trends, and cost variance displayed in real-time dashboard.

```
Dashboard Widgets:
  • Labor Cost Burn (actual vs budget)
  • Headcount Trend (week-over-week)
  • Productivity Efficiency by Trade
  • OT Percentage and Alert Flags
```

## 10. Alert Thresholds

### Automated Alert Rules

| Alert | Threshold | Action | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| OT Exceeds Limit | >15% of total hours | Warning | May indicate schedule pressure or staffing gaps |
| Crew Size Drop | >30% reduction week-over-week | Alert | Verify planned reduction or investigate delays |
| Productivity Below Benchmark | <80% efficiency | Alert | Review crew performance and work conditions |
| Missing Labor Entries | Trade active in daily report but no labor entries | Error | Foreman must provide entries or explanation |
| High Fringe Variance | >5% variance from prevailing wage rate | Alert | Verify Davis-Bacon compliance |
| Cost Overrun | >10% variance unfavorable vs budget | Alert | Analyze root cause and forecast impact |
| Apprentice Ratio Violation | <1:5 ratio on Davis-Bacon projects | Error | Adjust crew composition immediately |

### Example Alert Trigger

```
ALERT: Overtime Exceeds 15%
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Week: 2026-02-17 to 2026-02-23
Overtime Percentage: 18.2% (83 OT hours of 455 total)
Threshold: 15%
Overage: +3.2 percentage points

Contributing Factors:
  • Concrete crew: 2.5 OT hours (footing acceleration)
  • Steel crew: 4.0 OT hours (erection delay due to weather)
  • Sitework: 1.5 OT hours (cleanup/grading)

Recommendation:
  Review schedule for week of 02-24. Consider adding crew
  on Monday if steel erection continues to slip.
  Current forecast: 12% OT next week (within limits).
```

## 11. Best Practices for Construction Labor Tracking

### Daily Labor Entry Best Practices

1. **Timeliness**: Entries submitted within 24 hours of work date
2. **Accuracy**: Worker names and hours match time cards precisely
3. **Detailed Work Description**: Link labor hours to specific tasks and CSI divisions
4. **Weather Documentation**: Note weather conditions that impact productivity
5. **Prevailing Wage Compliance**: Ensure classifications match Davis-Bacon schedule

### Crew Management Best Practices

1. **Foreman Sign-Off**: Crew foreman reviews and validates daily entries
2. **Equipment Documentation**: Log equipment used each day (impacts productivity baseline)
3. **Site Conditions**: Document impacts (weather, access, material delays)
4. **Work Progress Quantification**: Always include measurable output (LF, SF, EA, etc.)
5. **Daily Report Reconciliation**: Cross-check labor entries against daily report before submission

### Productivity Tracking Best Practices

1. **Benchmark Validation**: Review industry benchmarks quarterly and adjust for project-specific conditions
2. **Weekly Trending**: Analyze weekly efficiency to spot trends early (improving vs declining)
3. **Crew Stability**: Track same crew over time to assess learning curve and crew cohesion
4. **Equipment Optimization**: Measure productivity impact of different tools/equipment
5. **Corrective Action**: When efficiency drops below 85%, investigate root cause within 48 hours

### Certified Payroll Best Practices

1. **Classification Accuracy**: Verify worker classifications match prevailing wage schedule monthly
2. **Fringe Benefit Tracking**: Maintain documentation of fringe benefit payments
3. **Apprentice Documentation**: Keep apprenticeship credentials on file and track ratios daily
4. **Wage Rate Compliance**: Subscribe to prevailing wage updates; implement rate changes immediately
5. **WH-347 Completeness**: Ensure all Davis-Bacon project weeks are reported within 7 days of week end

### Cost Integration Best Practices

1. **Burdened Rate Accuracy**: Update loaded rates quarterly with current overhead/fringe data
2. **Variance Analysis**: Review cost variance weekly and forecast final labor cost monthly
3. **Earned Value Tracking**: Calculate EV weekly to maintain cost and schedule forecasts
4. **Sub Cost Accountability**: Break out labor costs by subcontractor for performance tracking
5. **Budget Reconciliation**: True-up labor budget monthly with actual time cards and payroll

## 12. Integration with Other Foreman OS Skills

### Skill Dependencies and References

- **daily-report-format**: Crew counts and work descriptions feed labor validation
- **cost-tracking**: Labor hours drive actual cost (AC) for EVM
- **earned-value-management**: Productivity ratios calculate earned value
- **sub-performance**: Efficiency metrics feed performance scorecards
- **pay-application**: Labor summary supports T&M invoicing
- **look-ahead-planner**: Historical productivity informs resource planning
- **project-dashboard**: Labor charts and KPIs display in real-time dashboard

---



## 13. Implementation Notes

### Data Privacy and Security
- Labor entries contain worker names and hours; store securely
- Payroll data (WH-347) is confidential; restrict access to payroll and project managers
- PII (prevailing wage classifications) follows Davis-Bacon compliance requirements

### Calculation Engines
- **Total Hours Calculation**: Regular + (OT × 1.5) + (DT × 2.0) = Total Labor-Hours (for productivity ratio)
- **Labor Cost**: Hours × Burdened Rate = Cost
- **Productivity Ratio**: Output Quantity ÷ Total Labor-Hours = Ratio
- **Efficiency Factor**: Actual Ratio ÷ Benchmark Ratio = Efficiency (target: 100%)

### Migration and Onboarding
- Import labor entries from existing payroll systems (CSV/Excel format)
- Backfill productivity benchmarks from historical project data
- Train foremen on daily entry process; provide mobile-friendly form option
- Establish weekly reconciliation cadence with payroll department
