# Construction Progress Rendering Templates

Templates for rendering buildings at different construction phases, maintaining SAME camera angle across all phases for timelapse consistency. Each phase includes realistic construction elements, equipment, materials staging, and site conditions appropriate to that phase.

## Construction Phase Sequence

| Phase | Typical Timeline | Key Elements | Site Appearance |
|---|---|---|---|
| Existing Conditions | Before mobilization | Current site state | Baseline conditions |
| Excavation | Week 1-2 | Excavator, grading, cut/fill | Disturbed earth, staging areas |
| Foundation | Week 3-6 | Concrete forms, rebar, pouring equipment | Concrete trucks, curing | Formed footings, stem walls |
| Structural (PEMB Erection) | Week 7-10 | Crane, steel pieces, workers, equipment | Columns, frames, roof deck |
| Dried-In (Envelope) | Week 11-14 | Roof panels being installed, walls enclosed | Weathertight, some panels |
| Rough-In (MEP) | Week 15-19 | Equipment installation, ductwork, piping | Interior activity, exterior complete |
| Finishes | Week 20-26 | Interior construction, equipment install | Interior visible from openings |
| Substantial Completion | Week 27-30 | Final touches, cleanup, signage | Nearly complete appearance |
| Complete | Week 31+ | Final closeout | Professional finished building |

## Template Usage for Progress Sequences

### Single Phase Rendering

```bash
/render progress-foundation
→ Generates foundation-phase rendering using Phase 3 template
→ Camera angle established as baseline for potential series
```

### Complete Construction Sequence

```bash
/render progress-sequence --phases=excavation,foundation,structural,dried-in,rough-in,finishes,complete
→ Generates all 7 phases with IDENTICAL camera position
→ Enables timelapse viewing
→ Files organized chronologically
```

## Camera Consistency Critical

**CRITICAL RULE:** All phases in a sequence MUST use identical camera position:

- **Position**: 70 feet south of building, eye level (5 feet)
- **Distance**: Consistent 70-foot distance
- **Angle**: Looking at building, +2° upward angle
- **Focal Length**: 35mm equivalent
- **Composition**: Centered on building

This ensures smooth timelapse when images are sequenced.

## Progress Sequence Metadata

Each progress rendering should be logged with:

```json
{
  "phase": "foundation",
  "phase_sequence": 3,
  "elapsed_time": "4 weeks",
  "percent_complete": 25,
  "critical_path": "foundation - anchor bolts ready",
  "weather": "clear",
  "camera_position": "baseline-south-70ft",
  "next_milestone": "PEMB erection start"
}
```

## Quality Checkpoints for Progress Renderings

- [ ] Camera position identical to baseline (timelapse consistency)
- [ ] Construction elements realistic for phase (nothing too advanced/incomplete)
- [ ] Equipment appropriate to phase (heavy for excavation, specialized for finishes)
- [ ] Material condition matches phase (new concrete curing, panels bright, finishes installed)
- [ ] Lighting consistent with golden hour baseline (shadows consistent direction/length)
- [ ] Weather appropriate (no rain during pouring, clear for roofing)
- [ ] Site organization realistic (staging, safety, temporary systems)
- [ ] No anachronisms (HVAC units before structure complete, landscaping before site grade)
- [ ] Proportional progress (not too fast, realistic timeline)
- [ ] Professional construction documentation quality
