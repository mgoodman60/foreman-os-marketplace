# Camera Angles: Detailed Specifications for Rendering Perspectives

This guide defines precise camera positions, angles, and lens equivalents for every standard architectural rendering angle. Each angle serves specific purposes and communicates different aspects of the design. Specification includes lens equivalent, camera height, distance, angle of view, and example prompt language.

## Exterior Angles

### South Elevation

**Purpose**: Often the primary facade; shows main entry, primary weather exposure, most distinctive architectural features

**Camera Specification:**
- **Lens Equivalent**: 35-40mm (standard/slightly wide)
- **Camera Height**: 5-6 feet above grade (eye level)
- **Distance from Subject**: 1.5x building width (allows full building in frame with context)
- **Angle of View**: Horizontal plane, perpendicular to facade, minimal perspective distortion
- **Perspective Type**: One-point perspective (building face parallel to picture plane)
- **Vertical Alignment**: Slight uptilt to show sky and upper details, no extreme upward tilt

**Example Prompt Language:**
- "South facade elevation view, camera at eye level, entire building visible with clear sky above"
- "Straight-on south elevation from 100 feet distance, all primary details visible, eye-level perspective"
- "Full-height south facade, 40mm equivalent lens, square-on composition, blue sky background"

**Best For:**
- Marketing renderings
- Permit applications
- Primary facade showcase
- Site context shown to immediate sides

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Don't tilt camera severely upward; extreme converging lines look distorted
- Don't position too close; building should fit in frame with space to sides
- Don't use ultra-wide lens (below 28mm); will distort primary facade
- Don't shoot from ground level; eye-level (5-6 feet) is standard
- Don't shoot perpendicular at night without interior lighting; building goes black

---

### North Elevation

**Purpose**: Often secondary; shows rear facade, service areas, secondary entries, backup system expressions

**Camera Specification:**
- **Lens Equivalent**: 35-40mm (standard)
- **Camera Height**: 5-6 feet above grade
- **Distance from Subject**: 1.5x building width
- **Angle of View**: Perpendicular to facade, minimal perspective distortion
- **Perspective Type**: One-point perspective
- **Vertical Alignment**: Similar to south elevation; slight uptilt if architectural interest exists above

**Example Prompt Language:**
- "North elevation view, rear facade, secondary entries visible, eye-level camera position"
- "Straight-on north facade from 80 feet distance, 35mm equivalent lens, clear perspective"

**Best For:**
- Permitting documents
- Comprehensive facade review
- Secondary design expression
- Service area integration

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Don't make north facade appear neglected or utilitarian if design intent is unified
- Don't shoot from unusual angles; clarity requires perpendicular view
- Don't minimize landscape screening if provided
- Don't over-emphasize loading docks or service elements unless they're design features

---

### East & West Elevations

**Purpose**: Side facades; show massing depth, material transitions, end wall expression, relation to adjacent buildings

**Camera Specification:**
- **Lens Equivalent**: 40-50mm (slightly tighter to control depth perception)
- **Camera Height**: 5-6 feet above grade
- **Distance from Subject**: 1.5-2x building height (allows upper portion to be visible clearly)
- **Angle of View**: Perpendicular to side facade
- **Perspective Type**: One-point perspective
- **Vertical Alignment**: Slight uptilt; these facades often show gable ends or height variation

**Example Prompt Language:**
- "East elevation side view, building depth visible, 45mm equivalent lens, eye-level perspective"
- "West facade from side angle, material transitions and end wall visible, clear sky background"

**Best For:**
- Massing communication
- Material expression on side facades
- Relationship to adjacent structures
- Depth of building shown
- Gable or end-wall design details

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Don't position too close; building should fit cleanly in frame
- Don't use extreme wide angles that create barrel distortion
- Don't ignore shadow patterns that reveal building form
- Don't shoot at too high an angle; side facades need clear straight-on view

### 3/4 Perspective (All 4 Corners)

**Purpose**: Show depth, massing, overall form, site context, three-dimensional spatial understanding. Most versatile composition. Can show multiple facades simultaneously.

**Camera Specification:**
- **Lens Equivalent**: 24-35mm (moderately wide, allows multiple facades in frame)
- **Camera Height**: 5-8 feet above grade (slightly higher emphasizes landscape context)
- **Distance from Subject**: 2-3x maximum building dimension (creates comprehensive view)
- **Angle of View**: 45-degree angle to building corner (southwest, northwest, southeast, northeast)
- **Perspective Type**: Two-point perspective (both facades visible with converging lines)
- **Vertical Alignment**: Slight uptilt to show sky, environment, and upper massing; no extreme upward tilt

**Example Prompt Language:**
- "3/4 perspective from southwest corner, 30mm equivalent wide lens, full building and surrounding context visible"
- "Corner view showing multiple facades, building depth evident, landscaping context visible, eye-level camera position"
- "Northeast corner perspective, two-point perspective showing depth and massing, soft shadows defining form"

**Southwest Corner Variation:**
- **Best for**: Warm afternoon/golden hour lighting, main entry often visible
- **Typical Use**: Primary marketing, site plan understanding

**Northwest Corner Variation:**
- **Best for**: Morning light, shows north facade with depth
- **Typical Use**: Secondary marketing, comprehensive view

**Southeast Corner Variation:**
- **Best for**: Late afternoon light, shows south facade primary view
- **Typical Use**: Alternative marketing angle

**Northeast Corner Variation:**
- **Best for**: Morning light, site relationship visible
- **Typical Use**: Site context emphasis

**Best For:**
- Comprehensive design communication
- Site plan context
- Massing and form understanding

## Technical Considerations

### Lens Distortion
- **Ultra-wide (under 24mm)**: Barrel distortion apparent, lines curve, proportions distorted
- **Wide (24-35mm)**: Slight perspective distortion; acceptable for architectural renderings
- **Standard (35-50mm)**: Minimal distortion; most realistic rendering lens range
- **Telephoto (85-135mm)**: Perspective compression; flatters details but loses context

### Perspective Convergence
- **One-point perspective**: Most stable, used for elevation and corridor views; vertical lines stay parallel
- **Two-point perspective**: Dynamic, used for corner and site views; vertical lines slightly converge with extreme upward tilt
- **Extreme upward tilt (>45°)**: Vertical lines converge dramatically; use sparingly for special emphasis

### Professional Standards
- Most architectural renderings use 35-50mm equivalent range
- Entry and approach views benefit from 35-85mm range
- Avoid ultra-wide (below 24mm) except for specific spatial emphasis
- Avoid extreme telephoto (over 135mm) for general rendering; use only for detail focus
- Interior renderings typically avoid tilt to maintain level horizon (except for ceiling emphasis)

### Time-of-Day and Lens Choice
- **Morning/evening**: Shadows more dramatic; wider lenses help show full composition with low sun
- **Overcast**: Less shadow drama; telephoto lenses can isolate features better
- **Night**: Extreme wide angles capture more light sources; telephoto isolates entry lighting
