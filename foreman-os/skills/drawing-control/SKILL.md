# Drawing Control Skill — Foreman OS

## Overview

The **drawing-control** skill is the central nervous system for managing construction drawings in Foreman OS. It tracks every revision, incorporates Architect/Engineer directives (ASIs), flags superseded sheets, and ensures the field works from the current set. Drawing management directly impacts quality, safety, cost, and schedule — this skill prevents costly rework by controlling the flow of information from the A/E to the field.

### Core Responsibilities

- **Revision Tracking**: Maintain complete drawing log with revision history, dates, and change descriptions
- **ASI Processing**: Automatically update affected sheets when directives are received; flag superseded revisions
- **Current Set Verification**: Generate discipline-based reports of the latest drawing revision for every sheet
- **Field Audit**: Compare physical field sets against digital log; alert on out-of-date usage
- **Distribution Control**: Track which team members received which revision and when
- **Change Summary**: Extract revision cloud data and summarize deltas between revisions
- **Integration Pipeline**: Feed current drawing data to RFI prep, daily reports, submittals, and look-ahead planning

## 1. Drawing Log Data Model

The drawing-control skill stores all drawing metadata in a JSON schema. This provides a single source of truth for the project's drawing package.

### JSON Schema

```json
{
  "project_id": "string (e.g., MOSC-825021)",

## 2. ASI Processing Workflow

When the Architect or Engineer issues a Supplemental Instruction (ASI), the drawing-control skill manages the intake, revision updates, and distribution.

### ASI Receipt & Processing Steps

1. **Receive ASI** → Capture ASI number, date received, engineer/architect name
2. **Identify Affected Sheets** → Parse ASI document to extract sheet numbers impacted
3. **Update Revision Numbers** → Increment revision (Rev 0 → Rev 1, etc.) for each affected sheet
4. **Mark Superseded** → Flag previous revisions as superseded with ASI reference
5. **Extract Change Summary** → If revision clouds are present, summarize deltas
6. **Cross-Reference ASI Log** → Update project-config.json ASI table with drawing link
7. **Generate Distribution Notice** → List which sheets changed and who needs new copies
8. **Queue Automatic Re-distribution** → Trigger notifications to field team

### ASI Tracking Table Template

```markdown
| ASI # | Date Received | Issued By | Sheets Affected | Description | Status | Distribution Complete | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|--------|------------------------|-------|
| ASI-001 | 2026-01-15 | Smith Architects | A-101, A-102, A-103 | Floor plan revisions for door swing conflicts | Distributed | 2026-01-16 | All field copies updated |
| ASI-002 | 2026-02-05 | Yeiser Structural | S-201, S-202 | Anchor bolt layout modifications | Distributed | 2026-02-06 | Confirmed with steel sub |
| ASI-003 | 2026-02-18 | Davis HVAC | M-101, M-102 | Equipment substitution | Pending | - | Awaiting drawings from vendor |
```

### ASI-to-Revision Mapping

When an ASI requires drawing revisions, the mapping below ensures consistency:

```json
{
  "asi_number": "ASI-001",
  "date_received": "2026-01-15",
  "drawings_affected": [
    {
      "sheet_number": "A-101",
      "previous_revision": "Rev 0",
      "new_revision": "Rev 1",
      "description": "Door swing and furniture layout corrections"
    },
    {
      "sheet_number": "A-102",
      "previous_revision": "Rev 0",
      "new_revision": "Rev 1",
      "description": "Door swing and furniture layout corrections"
    }
  ],
  "distribution_initiated": "2026-01-16",
  "distribution_complete": true
}
```

## 3. Current Set Verification

The drawing-control skill generates on-demand reports showing the latest revision of every sheet in the project.

### Current Set Report (By Discipline)

**Command**: `/drawings status`

Sample output:

```

## 4. Revision Cloud Summary

When new drawing revisions are received, the drawing-control skill extracts and summarizes revision cloud data (if available in PDFs).

### Revision Delta Extraction

```json
{
  "drawing_id": "A-101-001",
  "sheet_number": "A-101",
  "comparison": {
    "from_revision": "Rev 0",
    "to_revision": "Rev 1",
    "change_date": "2026-01-15",
    "change_summary": "Door swing corrections in Patient Rooms A-101, A-102. Furniture layout adjusted to ADA path of travel. Casework dimensions verified per Stidham quote.",
    "revision_clouds": [
      {
        "location": "Grid 3/B-C (Patient Room 101)",
        "description": "Door swing corrected from inward to outward swing; casework depth reduced 6 inches",
        "change_type": "major"
      },
      {
        "location": "Grid 4/C-D (Patient Room 102)",
        "description": "Door swing reversed; ADA clearance verified",
        "change_type": "moderate"
      },
      {
        "location": "Grid 2/A-B (Corridor)",
        "description": "Furniture layout clarification; no dimension changes",
        "change_type": "minor"
      }
    ],
    "affected_systems": ["Doors", "Casework", "Layout"],
    "impact_assessment": "Affects EKD (drywall/framing) and Stidham (casework) scope. Review with subs before framing."
  }
}
```

## 5. Drawing Distribution Log

The drawing-control skill tracks who received which revision and when, providing accountability and re-distribution triggers.

### Distribution Log Entry

```json
{
  "sheet_number": "A-101",
  "revision": "Rev 1",
  "distribution_round": 1,
  "date_distributed": "2026-01-16",
  "distribution_list": [
    {
      "recipient": "W Principles (Super - Miles Goodman)",
      "role": "Super",
      "method": "email",
      "date_sent": "2026-01-16",
      "email": "miles.goodman@wprinciples.com",
      "confirmed_receipt": true,
      "receipt_date": "2026-01-16"
    },
    {
      "recipient": "Andrew Eberle (PM)",
      "role": "PM",
      "method": "email",
      "date_sent": "2026-01-16",
      "email": "andrew.eberle@wprinciples.com",
      "confirmed_receipt": true,
      "receipt_date": "2026-01-16"
    },
    {
      "recipient": "EKD (Drywall/CFS Sub - Foreman)",
      "role": "Sub",
      "method": "email",
      "date_sent": "2026-01-16",
      "email": "foreman@ekd-drywall.com",
      "confirmed_receipt": false,
      "receipt_date": null
    },
    {
      "recipient": "Stidham Cabinets (Casework Sub)",
      "role": "Sub",
      "method": "email",
      "date_sent": "2026-01-16",
      "email": "office@stidhamcabinets.com",
      "confirmed_receipt": true,
      "receipt_date": "2026-01-17"
    }
  ],
  "re_distribution_required": false,
  "notes": "ASI-001 revision; follow-up call made to EKD on 2026-01-17 to confirm receipt."
}
```

### Automatic Re-distribution Triggers

The skill automatically initiates re-distribution when:
- New revision issued for a sheet already in circulation
- ASI affects multiple sheets in one directive
- Field reports reference superseded revision
- Submittal review flagged a drawing as outdated
