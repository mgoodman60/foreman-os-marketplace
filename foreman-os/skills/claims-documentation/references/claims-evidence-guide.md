# Claims Evidence Guide

## Documentation Standards, Notice Templates, and Damages Calculation Methods

This reference provides field-ready standards for building defensible construction claims. It covers evidence quality requirements, notice letter templates, damages calculation worksheets, and documentation protocols. Use this as a quick-reference companion to the full claims-documentation skill.

## 1. Evidence Quality Standards

### Admissibility Fundamentals

Construction disputes -- whether resolved through negotiation, mediation, arbitration, or litigation -- rely on evidence. Not all evidence is created equal. Understanding what makes evidence admissible and persuasive is the first step to building a defensible claim.

**Relevance**: The evidence must relate directly to the claimed event, impact, or damages. A daily report from a date outside the delay period is not relevant to that delay claim.

**Authenticity**: The evidence must be what it purports to be. An unaltered photograph with EXIF metadata is authentic. A cropped, undated photograph may be challenged.

**Reliability**: The evidence must be trustworthy. A daily report written and signed on the day of observation is reliable. A report reconstructed six months later from memory is less reliable.

### Weight of Evidence

Even when evidence is admissible, its persuasive weight varies:

| Evidence Type | Weight | Why |
|--------------|--------|-----|
| Original daily report (same-day, signed) | Highest | Contemporaneous, authored by witness |
| Photographs with EXIF metadata | Very high | Objective, timestamped, location-tagged |
| Emails with original headers | Very high | Timestamped, traceable to sender |
| Inspection reports (third-party) | High | Independent observer |
| Meeting minutes (distributed within 48 hrs) | High | Multiple parties reviewed |
| Weather data (NOAA official records) | High | Government source, objective |
| Handwritten field notes (dated, signed) | Moderate-high | Contemporaneous but subjective |
| Weekly reports summarizing daily events | Moderate | Slight delay in creation |
| Reconstructed records (after-the-fact) | Low | Memory bias, self-serving risk |
| Oral testimony without documentation | Lowest | Unreliable memory, no corroboration |

### Best Evidence Rule

When the original document is available, present the original -- not a copy, summary, or recollection of its contents. This applies to:
- Contracts (present the signed original, not a draft or unsigned copy)
- Photographs (present the original file with metadata, not a screenshot or compressed version)
- Emails (present the full chain with headers, not a forwarded excerpt)
- Daily reports (present the signed original, not a typed summary)

### Negative Evidence

Sometimes the absence of a record is itself evidence. If daily reports for a three-week period never mention weather delays, that absence undermines a later claim that weather caused delays during that period. Maintain consistent documentation so gaps do not create negative evidence against your position.

## 4. Photo and Video Documentation Protocol

### Daily Photo Requirements

**Minimum photo set for standard project day (no active claims)**:
1. Site overview from consistent vantage point (same angle daily for time-lapse comparison)
2. Each active work area showing progress
3. Material deliveries (truck, delivery ticket, material condition)
4. Weather conditions (sky, ground conditions, temperature display if available)

**Expanded photo set for claims-sensitive situations**:
1. All standard photos above
2. Condition causing the claim (delay, disruption, differing conditions) -- multiple angles
3. Idle crews and equipment with time reference (watch/phone showing time in frame)
4. Scale references (tape measure, ruler, known objects)
5. Context photos (wide shot showing surrounding area, then close-up of specific condition)
6. Before and after (if conditions are changing)

### Photo Naming Convention

```
Format: [PROJECT]-[DATE]-[SEQUENCE]-[LOCATION]-[SUBJECT].jpg

Examples:
  MOSC-20260315-001-SW-2FL-ductwork-conflict.jpg
  MOSC-20260315-002-SW-2FL-column-C7-measurement.jpg
  MOSC-20260315-003-SITE-weather-standing-water.jpg
  MOSC-20260315-004-EAST-idle-crane-standby.jpg
```

### Video Documentation Protocol

**Weekly walkthrough structure**:
1. State date, time, project name, and your name at the beginning
2. Start at site entrance, walk through all active work areas
3. At each area: state location, describe current work, note any issues
4. Pause 5-10 seconds at key areas for clear footage
5. Include scale references where relevant
6. End with summary of key observations
7. Duration: 15-30 minutes for typical project

**Claim-specific video**:
1. State date, time, and specific claim reference (e.g., "This video documents conditions related to CLAIM-001")
2. Focus exclusively on the claimed condition
3. Narrate in factual terms -- describe what you see, not conclusions
4. Include measurements and scale references
5. Show surrounding context
6. Duration: 5-15 minutes per specific condition

---

## 5. Document Retention Requirements

### Minimum Retention Periods

| Document Type | Retention Period | Basis |
|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| Contract documents | 10 years after final payment | Statute of limitations (longest state) |
| Daily reports | 6 years after substantial completion | Statute of limitations (typical) |
| Photographs/video | 6 years after substantial completion | Evidence preservation |
| Financial records | 7 years | IRS requirements |
| Safety records | 5 years (OSHA 300 logs: duration + 5 years) | OSHA 29 CFR 1904.33 |
| Correspondence | 6 years after substantial completion | Statute of limitations |
| Claims documentation | 10 years after final resolution | Post-resolution statute |
| Insurance certificates | Life of structure | Latent defect claims |
| Warranties | Warranty period + 2 years | Warranty enforcement |

### Storage Requirements

- **Primary storage**: Cloud-based, access-controlled, with automatic backup
- **Secondary storage**: Physical copies of critical documents (contracts, notices, key correspondence)
- **Access control**: Limit editing access; read-only for most users
- **Audit trail**: System that logs who accessed, modified, or downloaded files
- **Disaster recovery**: Geographic redundancy (data stored in multiple locations)

### Litigation Hold

When a dispute becomes likely or is formally initiated:
1. **Immediately** issue a litigation hold notice to all project team members
2. **Preserve all documents** -- no deletion, modification, or routine purging
3. **Expand scope**: Preserve personal devices, text messages, voicemails
4. **Document the hold**: Record date issued, recipients, and scope
5. **Failure to preserve** can result in spoliation sanctions (adverse inference, fines)
