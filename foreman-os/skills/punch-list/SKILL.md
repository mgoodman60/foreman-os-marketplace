# Punch List Skill

## Overview
Comprehensive punch list management system for construction projects. Tracks identification and resolution of deficiencies from initial walk-through through final closeout. Supports photo documentation, back-charge management, and professional reporting for inspections and regulatory compliance.

## Punch Item Schema

### Core Fields
- **id** (string): Unique identifier, format "PUNCH-{NNN}" (e.g., "PUNCH-001", "PUNCH-042")
  - Auto-generated on creation, incremental within project
  - Never reused, immutable
  - Enables clear reference in conversations and reports

### Location Fields (One or more required)
- **room_number** (string): Room or space identifier (e.g., "Room 107", "306B", "ICU-2")
  - Used for healthcare: patient rooms, operating rooms, medication dispensary
  - Standard for office/commercial: office numbers, conference rooms
- **building_area** (string): Larger zone reference (e.g., "East Wing", "3rd Floor", "North Corridor")
  - Supports multi-floor, multi-wing projects
  - Hierarchical: "Building A > East Wing > 3rd Floor"
- **grid_reference** (string): Coordinate system, optional (e.g., "Grid C3", "Section 4B")
  - Used in large-scale or modular projects
- **floor_level** (integer): Floor number or level (e.g., 3, -1 for basement)
  - Supports vertical organization; assists in access planning

### Identification & Documentation
- **description** (string, required): Clear, specific deficiency description
  - Example: "Drywall mud pops in northeast corner, joint at ceiling"

- **identified_by** (string): Name of person who identified the item
  - Usually superintendent or foreman
  - Accountability and follow-up contact

### Status & Workflow
- **status** (enum): Current state of item
  - **open**: Newly identified, awaiting assignment
  - **in_progress**: Sub notified and work initiated
  - **completed**: Work finished, may be pending inspection
  - **back_charge**: Assigned back-charge (sub failed to correct)

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Transitions
1. **open → in_progress**: Sub acknowledged and beginning work (via status update)
2. **in_progress → completed**: Work finished, verified by superintendent (date_completed, completed_by set)
3. **open/in_progress → back_charge**: Sub failed to correct; back-charge issued (amount and reason required)
4. **back_charge → completed**: GC corrected work or sub completed after back-charge warning
5. **Any state → disputed**: Item contested (reason required; typically returns to prior state after resolution)

## Completion Statistics Calculations

### By Location
- **Room/Area Completion %** = (completed items in location / total items in location) × 100
- Supports dashboard display: "Room 107: 4/5 items done (80%)"

### By Trade
- **Trade Completion %** = (completed items by trade / total items by trade) × 100
- Supports dashboard display: "Drywall: 12/15 items done (80%)"

### By Priority
- **Priority A Completion %** = (completed A items / total A items) × 100 [**must = 100% for final sign-off**]
- **Priority B Completion %** = (completed B items / total B items) × 100
- **Priority C Completion %** = (completed C items / total C items) × 100 [**may be <100% if owner accepts**]

### Overall Project
- **Overall Completion %** = (total completed items / total punch items) × 100
- **Open Count** = items with status = "open"
- **In Progress Count** = items with status = "in_progress"
- **Back-Charge Count** = items with status = "back_charge"
- **Disputed Count** = items with status = "disputed"

## Bulk Operations

### Bulk Add
User input: *"I found 5 items in Room 107: mud pops, paint scuff, missing outlet, cracked tile, missing grout."*

Process:
1. Extract location: "Room 107"
2. Parse items: Create array of 5 items
3. Prompt for common fields once: Trade (prompt per item or once for all?)
   - If same trade: ask "All drywall?" → apply to all
   - If mixed: ask per item or accept trade in bulk input
4. Auto-assign responsible_sub: resolve from project subs directory
5. Auto-generate IDs: PUNCH-001 through PUNCH-005
6. Set all: date_identified = today, identified_by = current user, status = "open", priority = ?
7. Save to punch list

### Bulk Status Update
User input: *"All drywall items in Room 107 are done. Mark them completed."*

Process:
1. Query punch list: filter by room_number="Room 107" AND trade="Drywall"
2. Display matching items for confirmation
3. Update all: status = "completed", date_completed = today, completed_by = user
4. Save and log bulk update in version_history

## Integration Points

### Project Dashboard (`/project-dashboard`)
- **Punch Completion Widget**: Overall % complete, trending over time
- **By Area Chart**: Bar chart showing % complete per room/area
- **By Trade Chart**: Bar chart showing % complete per sub discipline
- **Priority Status**: Count of open A/B/C items
- **Days Open Trending**: Aging analysis; items open >14 days highlighted
- **Back-Charge Summary**: Total amount, count of flagged items

### Daily Report (`/daily-report`)
- **Punch Walk Findings** section: Can reference new items identified during day
  - Example: "Punch walk identified 3 new items in Room 107 (see punch list PUNCH-041, PUNCH-042, PUNCH-043)"
- **Completion Status**: Reference punch completion % for area worked that day
- **Back-Charge Updates**: Log any back-charges issued or resolved

### Closeout Workflow
- **Pre-Final Punch List**: All items listed and assigned; Priority A completion required
- **Final Punch List**: All Priority A done, Priority B >90% complete; Priority C completion optional if owner approved
- **Block Conditions**:
  - Disputed items halt final sign-off
  - Priority A items must = 100%
  - All back-charges must be resolved or owner must accept liability

## Rules & Constraints

1. **No Item Deletion**: Punch items are immutable history; status changes only (set to "completed" or "back_charge")
2. **Priority Cannot Decrease**: Cannot downgrade A → B or B → C once set (can only escalate: C → B → A if severity discovered)
3. **Back-Charge Amount Required**: If status = "back_charge", back_charge_amount must be >0 and back_charge_reason must be provided
4. **Completion Metadata**: Transition to "completed" requires date_completed and completed_by fields populated
5. **Location Required**: Every item must have at least room_number OR building_area defined
6. **Responsible Sub Required**: Every item must reference a valid sub from subs directory
7. **Priority A = 100% for Final**: Project cannot reach final sign-off without all Priority A items completed
8. **Disputes Block Closeout**: Status = "disputed" requires resolution before completion
