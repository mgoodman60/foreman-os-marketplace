# Risk Management Skill

## Overview

The **risk-management** skill provides proactive risk identification and management for construction superintendents and project managers. Most construction management tools track problems **after** they happen -- this skill identifies risks **before** they materialize, enabling the project team to avoid, transfer, reduce, or accept risks through deliberate strategy rather than reactive firefighting.

Construction projects are inherently risk-laden: site conditions are uncertain, weather is unpredictable, supply chains are fragile, labor markets fluctuate, and regulatory requirements evolve. A superintendent who manages risk proactively can prevent schedule slippage, cost overruns, safety incidents, and quality failures before they occur.

This skill provides:
- Systematic risk identification using multiple methods (brainstorming, checklists, SWOT, historical review, site walk-through)
- Quantitative risk assessment using a 5x5 Probability x Impact matrix
- Construction-specific risk categories with common triggers and recommended mitigations
- A structured risk register data model for tracking risks from identification through resolution
- Mitigation strategy selection framework (avoid, transfer, reduce, accept)
- Contingency budget allocation and drawdown tracking
- Weather contingency planning with activity-specific thresholds
- Force majeure management with notice and documentation requirements
- Monthly risk review meeting structure with reporting templates
- Integration with other ForemanOS skills for holistic project management

**Key Principle**: Risk management is not a one-time exercise. The risk register is a living document reviewed monthly (at minimum) and updated whenever project conditions change. Risks are dynamic -- new risks emerge as the project progresses, and existing risks change in probability and impact as work advances.

## Risk Identification Methods

Effective risk management begins with thorough identification. No single method captures all risks; use multiple approaches throughout the project lifecycle.

### 1. Brainstorming (Project Kickoff Risk Workshop)

Conduct a structured brainstorming session at project kickoff with the full project team:

**Participants**: Project Manager, Superintendent, Project Engineer, Key Subcontractors (structural, MEP, civil), Owner's Representative (if willing)

**Format**:
- 60-90 minute facilitated session
- Round-robin format: each participant identifies one risk per round
- No filtering during brainstorming -- capture everything
- Categorize risks after brainstorming is complete
- Assign initial probability/impact ratings as a group
- Identify risk owners for each risk

**Timing**: Within first two weeks of project mobilization; repeat at each major phase transition

**Output**: Initial risk register populated with 20-50 risks (typical for mid-size commercial project)

### 2. Checklist-Based Identification (Construction-Specific Risk Checklist)

Walk through a structured checklist organized by risk category. This ensures common construction risks are not overlooked:

**Checklist Categories** (detailed in Construction-Specific Risk Categories section):
- Site Conditions
- Weather
- Labor
- Supply Chain
- Regulatory/Permitting
- Design Completeness
- Subcontractor Performance
- Financial
- Force Majeure
- Safety

For each category, review the common risk items and assess whether they apply to the current project. Mark each as "applicable" or "not applicable" with justification.

### 3. SWOT Analysis (Project-Level)

Perform a project-level SWOT analysis to identify risks from a strategic perspective:

- **Strengths**: What advantages does the project team have? (experienced crew, familiar building type, strong sub relationships)
- **Weaknesses**: What limitations exist? (first project in this jurisdiction, compressed schedule, tight budget, new building type)
- **Opportunities**: What external factors could benefit the project? (favorable weather season, strong labor market, owner flexibility)
- **Threats**: What external factors could harm the project? (supply chain disruptions, regulatory changes, adjacent construction, economic downturn)

Threats and Weaknesses translate directly into risk register entries.

### 4. Historical Data Review (Similar Project Lessons Learned)

Review lessons learned from similar completed projects:

- What risks materialized on past projects of similar scope, size, and type?
- What risks were underestimated or missed entirely?
- What mitigation strategies worked well and which failed?
- What schedule/cost overruns occurred and what were root causes?

**Sources**:
- Company lessons-learned database
- Post-project review reports
- Superintendent personal experience log
- Industry publications and case studies for the building type

### 5. Site Walk-Through Identification

Conduct a deliberate risk-focused site walk-through (distinct from daily quality/safety walks):

**Physical Observations**:
- Access constraints (narrow roads, limited staging, adjacent occupied buildings)
- Topography and drainage patterns (flooding risk areas)
- Existing utilities (overhead power lines, underground utilities, active services)
- Adjacent structures (settlement risk, party wall conditions, shared access)
- Soil conditions visible at surface (rock outcrops, standing water, fill areas)
- Environmental indicators (wetlands, protected species habitat, contamination signs)

**Logistical Observations**:
- Material delivery access and staging areas
- Crane placement options and swing radius constraints
- Temporary power/water availability
- Laydown area capacity vs. project needs
- Traffic patterns affecting deliveries and crew access

## Risk Assessment Framework

### 5x5 Probability x Impact Matrix

All risks are assessed using a standardized 5x5 matrix that quantifies both the likelihood of occurrence and the severity of impact if the risk materializes.

### Probability Scale

| Level | Rating | Description | Probability Range |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Rare | Highly unlikely to occur; no precedent on similar projects | < 5% |
| 2 | Unlikely | Could occur but not expected; has occurred on rare projects | 5% - 20% |
| 3 | Possible | Reasonable chance of occurring; has occurred on some similar projects | 20% - 50% |
| 4 | Likely | More likely than not; common on similar projects or conditions suggest occurrence | 50% - 80% |
| 5 | Almost Certain | Expected to occur; project conditions strongly indicate occurrence | > 80% |

### Impact Scale

| Level | Rating | Schedule Impact | Cost Impact | Description |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Negligible | < 1 day | < $5,000 | Minor inconvenience; absorbed within normal operations |
| 2 | Minor | 1 - 5 days | $5,000 - $25,000 | Noticeable but manageable; requires minor schedule adjustment or budget reallocation |
| 3 | Moderate | 5 - 20 days | $25,000 - $100,000 | Significant disruption; requires formal schedule recovery or change order |
| 4 | Major | 20 - 60 days | $100,000 - $500,000 | Severe impact; threatens milestone dates, requires contract extension and major cost recovery |
| 5 | Critical | > 60 days | > $500,000 | Project-threatening; potential for project suspension, litigation, or fundamental scope change |

### Risk Score Calculation

```
Risk Score = Probability x Impact
```

### Risk Priority Categories

| Score Range | Priority | Color | Action Required |
|-------------|----------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 - 4 | Low | Green | Monitor; review monthly; no active mitigation required |
| 5 - 9 | Medium | Yellow | Active monitoring; mitigation plan documented; review bi-weekly |
| 10 - 15 | High | Orange | Active mitigation underway; escalate to PM; review weekly |
| 16 - 25 | Critical | Red | Immediate action required; escalate to executive leadership; daily monitoring |

### Assessment Guidelines

**When rating probability**:
- Consider project-specific conditions, not just general industry statistics
- Account for current project phase (early = more uncertainty = higher probability for unknowns)
- Factor in team experience with this risk type
- Review historical data from similar projects

**When rating impact**:
- Assess both schedule AND cost impact; use the higher rating
- Consider cascading effects (one delay triggering downstream delays)
- Account for critical path sensitivity (critical path activities have amplified impact)
- Factor in contractual penalties (liquidated damages amplify schedule impact)
- Consider reputational and relationship impact (harder to quantify but real)

**Re-assessment frequency**:
- Critical risks (16-25): Weekly
- High risks (10-15): Bi-weekly
- Medium risks (5-9): Monthly
- Low risks (1-4): Monthly or at phase transitions
