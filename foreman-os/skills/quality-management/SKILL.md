# Quality Management System (QMS)

## Overview

The Quality Management System is a formal, three-phase construction quality framework organized by CSI division and trade. It ensures specification compliance, minimizes rework costs, and creates comprehensive, auditable quality records for every phase of construction.

**Primary Purpose**: Convert design intent and specifications into built reality with zero defects and full documentation.

**Scope**: Applies to all trades and materials from foundation through final punch-list closeout.

**Key Outcomes**:
- Reduction in rework cost (target: <2% of contract value)
- First-Pass Inspection Rate (FPIR) above 90%
- Zero code violations at final inspection
- Complete digital quality trail for O&M handoff

---

## QMS Philosophy: Three Pillars

### 1. Prevention (Pre-Installation)

Quality built in from the beginning. Before any work starts:
- Verify all materials meet specification
- Confirm crews understand acceptance criteria
- Complete prep work to documented standards
- Ensure MEP coordination is resolved
- Review and approve all submittals
- Identify and resolve clashes before installation

**Prevention Cost**: Investment in planning, verification, and coordination = lowest cost to quality.

### 2. Conformance (Installation Monitoring)

Real-time quality control during construction:
- Daily observation by field leadership and trade foremen
- In-progress measurements and testing
- Immediate corrective action when non-conformance detected
- Photo documentation of critical phases
- Hold points verified before proceeding
- Test data recorded and trended

**Conformance Cost**: Active supervision and testing = moderate cost, prevents rework.

### 3. Documentation (Post-Installation)

Permanent quality record:
- Final inspection checklists signed and filed
- Test reports and material certs retained
- Deficiencies resolved and verified
- As-built data verified
- Warranty and startup documentation complete
- O&M team trained on quality standards

**Documentation Cost**: Low (mostly administrative), enables warranty support and operations.

## Three-Phase Inspection Structure by Trade

Each major trade follows a standardized three-phase inspection protocol: Pre-Installation (setup), Installation (monitoring), and Post-Installation (verification).
