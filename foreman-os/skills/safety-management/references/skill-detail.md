## Safety Metrics & Reporting

### TRIR (Total Recordable Incident Rate)

**Definition**: Number of recordable incidents per 200,000 hours worked (standard industry metric representing 100 full-time employees working 1 year).

**Formula**:
```
TRIR = (Total Recordable Cases × 200,000) / Total Hours Worked

Example:
  Recordable Cases in 2026: 2
  Total Hours Worked: 50,000 hours
  TRIR = (2 × 200,000) / 50,000 = 8.0

  Interpretation: 8.0 TRIR means 8 recordable incidents per 200,000 hours
  Industry Average (Construction): 3.5-4.0 TRIR
  Project Rating: ABOVE AVERAGE INCIDENT RATE (needs improvement)
```

**Calculation Frequency**: Monthly, quarterly, annually

**Benchmark Comparison**:
- Construction Industry Average: 3.5-4.0 TRIR
- Excellent Safety Culture: <2.0 TRIR
- Poor Safety Performance: >6.0 TRIR

### DART Rate (Days Away, Restricted, Transferred)

**Definition**: Number of incidents with days away from work OR restricted duty OR job transfer per 200,000 hours worked.

**Formula**:
```
DART Rate = (Total DART Cases × 200,000) / Total Hours Worked

Total DART Cases = Cases with Days Away + Restricted Duty + Job Transfer

Example:
  Cases with Days Away: 1
  Cases with Restricted Duty: 1
  Cases with Job Transfer: 0
  Total DART Cases: 2
  Total Hours Worked: 50,000
  DART Rate = (2 × 200,000) / 50,000 = 8.0

  Interpretation: 8.0 DART rate
  Industry Average: 2.5-3.0 DART rate
  Project Rating: ABOVE AVERAGE SEVERITY
```

**Comparison to TRIR**:
- DART rates are subset of TRIR (only incidents with work impact)
- DART rate indicates severity (how many incidents caused lost time)
- High DART with low TRIR = few incidents, but severe
- High TRIR with low DART = many incidents, mostly minor

### EMR (Experience Modification Rate)

**Definition**: EMR is used by workers' compensation insurance to adjust premium rates based on company's safety history compared to industry average.

**EMR Calculation** (simplified):
```
EMR = Actual Loss Experience / Expected Loss Experience

EMR = 1.0: Company at average risk (standard rates)
EMR < 1.0: Company better than average (rate discount, e.g., 0.85 = 15% discount)
EMR > 1.0: Company worse than average (rate increase, e.g., 1.25 = 25% premium increase)

3-Year Experience Period: Most insurance carriers use trailing 3-year loss history
```

**Impact**: EMR directly affects company insurance costs:
- Better EMR (lower than 1.0) = lower premiums (financial incentive for safety)
- Worse EMR (higher than 1.0) = higher premiums (financial penalty)

**How to Improve EMR**:
1. Reduce recordable incident frequency (fewer claims)
2. Reduce severity (fewer/shorter days away from work)
3. Implement robust safety program (demonstrates commitment)
4. Return-to-work programs (reduce days away)
5. Incident investigation and corrective actions (prevent recurrence)

### Leading Indicators vs. Lagging Indicators

**Lagging Indicators** (after-the-fact; reactive):
- Recordable incidents
- TRIR rate
- DART rate
- Days away from work
- Medical costs
- Workers' compensation claims

**Leading Indicators** (proactive; preventive):
- Toolbox talks held
- JSAs completed/reviewed
- Safety inspections conducted
- Near-miss reports
- Corrective actions completed
- Training attendance
- Pre-task planning performed
- Safety violations identified and corrected

**Key Principle**: Focus on **leading indicators**. Improving leading indicators drives down lagging indicators.

**Example**:
- Leading: Increase toolbox talks from 1/week to 5/week (more safety communication)
- Expected Result: Fewer incidents (improved lagging indicator)

  TRIR YTD = (1 × 200,000) / 2,500 = 80.0

  Note: TRIR will stabilize as hours accumulate. First month inflated due to low denominator.

DART RATE (YTD):
  Total DART Cases: 0 (incident did not involve days away or restricted duty)
  DART Rate YTD = 0.0

LEADING INDICATORS:
  Toolbox Talks: 8 (target: 4-5/month; on track)
  JSAs Completed: 3 (Concrete Pour, Excavation, Roofing Panel Installation)
  Safety Inspections: 5 formal inspections
  Near-Miss Reports: 4 (encouraging proactive reporting)
  Training Completed: All crew orientation (100%)
  Corrective Actions Completed: 100% (all deficiencies closed)

SAFETY FOCUS AREAS:
  ✓ Strong toolbox talk participation
  ✓ High near-miss reporting (proactive hazard identification)
  ✓ Rapid corrective action closure
  ✓ Low incident rate (0 recordable for first month)

  Risk Areas:
  - PEMB erection beginning (high-risk phase upcoming)
  - Weather variability (cold/frost in February impacted excavation)
  - New crew onboarding for steel phase

UPCOMING HIGH-RISK ACTIVITIES:
  - PEMB erection (3/23-4/3): Daily safety briefings, increased inspections
  - Roofing operations (4/6-4/17): Fall protection focus
  - MEP rough-in (4/27-5/15): Confined space training (if applicable)

EMR PROJECTION:
  Current EMR: Not yet available (insufficient historical data)
  Projection: If incident rate continues at <1 recordable incident/month, EMR should improve

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Maintain current toolbox talk frequency during PEMB erection
  2. Increase daily safety briefings for high-risk steel phase
  3. Verify all fall protection equipment before roofing begins
  4. Continue near-miss reporting program (demonstrates safety culture)
  5. Post monthly metrics visibly (team transparency)

### Deficiency Tracking & Corrective Actions

**Deficiency Classification**:

1. **Minor** (Corrected Same Day)
   - Low hazard severity
   - Quick/simple fix
   - Examples: PPE not worn, cable in walkway (moved), unsecured tool
   - Closed: Same day or within 24 hours

2. **Major** (Requires Formal Corrective Action Plan)
   - Higher hazard severity
   - Requires resources, planning, or engineering
   - Examples: Improper shoring, missing anchor points, equipment defect
   - Timeline: 3-7 days typical; depends on hazard severity

**Corrective Action Tracking**:

## Integration with Daily Reports & Commands

### Auto-Capture in Daily Reports

Daily report `/morning-brief` includes safety section:
```
SAFETY ALERTS
- Incidents today? (y/n)
- Near-misses to report? (y/n)
- First aid treatments?
- Toolbox talk held? (topic)
- Safety concerns/observations?
```

If incident logged, auto-populates in `safety-log.json` and generates alert.

### Integration with Other Skills

**Inspection-Tracker**: Formal inspections logged separately; safety-management picks up deficiencies for tracking and closure

**Daily-Report**: Safety incidents captured; linked to safety-log

**Delay-Tracker**: If incident causes work stoppage, can be logged as safety delay

**Project-Dashboard**: Safety metrics displayed (TRIR, DART, leading indicators)
