## Photo Quality Standards Checklist

### BEFORE SUBMITTING A PHOTO FOR PROJECT RECORD:

**Clarity & Focus**
- [ ] Image is in sharp focus (no blur or camera shake)
- [ ] Subject of photo clearly visible and identifiable
- [ ] Detail visible without need for magnification
- [ ] Lighting adequate (not too dark, not washed out by glare)

**Composition & Framing**
- [ ] Subject properly framed (not cut off, not overly distant)
- [ ] Context visible showing relationship to adjacent work
- [ ] Distracting objects not prominent in frame
- [ ] Horizontal lines level (avoid tilted horizon or walls)

**Information Content**
- [ ] Grid location visible or noted in metadata
- [ ] Scale reference visible (measuring tape, person, known dimension)
- [ ] Trade/work type obvious from photo
- [ ] Deficiency/feature clearly documented (before/after evident)
- [ ] Related documents (RFI/punch/submittal) identified

**Technical Quality**
- [ ] File size appropriate (compressed but readable; typically 1.5-3 MB JPG)
- [ ] EXIF data preserved (date/time metadata intact)
- [ ] Color accurate (white balance appropriate for lighting)
- [ ] No watermarks or overlays obscuring detail
- [ ] Original file saved (not edited version if original available)

### REJECT PHOTO IF:
- [ ] Out of focus or blurry (especially for quality inspection photos)
- [ ] Subject partially cut off or too small to see detail
- [ ] Excessive glare washing out important elements
- [ ] Duplicate of previous photo without visible progress/change
- [ ] Scale/dimension unclear for specification verification
- [ ] No metadata or unclear documentation of location/subject

## Common Photo Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Backlit Subject
**Problem**: Sun behind subject creates silhouette, details invisible.
**Solution**: Position sun behind camera. If unavoidable, use flash to fill shadows.

### Mistake #2: Inconsistent Angles
**Problem**: Progress photos from different angles/distances don't show actual progression.
**Solution**: Mark photo location on site map. Return to exact same spot for comparison shots.

### Mistake #3: No Scale Reference
**Problem**: Detail photo shows defect but unclear how big/significant.
**Solution**: Include measuring tape, person, or known dimension in frame.

### Mistake #4: Missing Context
**Problem**: Close-up detail photo but unclear where in building/project it's located.
**Solution**: Always take both overview photo (context) and detail photo for important documentation.

### Mistake #5: Duplicate Photos
**Problem**: Multiple photos of same angle/condition; wastes storage, doesn't add information.
**Solution**: Take one good photo per angle. If retaking, do from different angle or after visible progress.

### Mistake #6: Excessive Shadows
**Problem**: Noon sunlight creates harsh shadows obscuring details.
**Solution**: Photograph in morning (10 AM) or afternoon (2-3 PM) for better shadow angles.

### Mistake #7: Blurry Images
**Problem**: Camera shake or focus on wrong object results in unusable photo.
**Solution**: Stabilize camera (tripod if available). Use autofocus on subject. Take multiple shots.

### Mistake #8: Cropped Grid References
**Problem**: Grid line marker at edge of photo, partially cut off.
**Solution**: Include full grid line or reference marker within frame with margin space.

### Mistake #9: No Metadata
**Problem**: Photo taken but date/location/context lost within weeks.
**Solution**: Use phone/camera timestamp. Add notes immediately in photo app. Include in daily photo log.

### Mistake #10: Edited/Compressed Beyond Recognition
**Problem**: Original photo edited or compressed so heavily detail is lost.
**Solution**: Preserve original files. Use standard compression (JPG at 85% quality).

## Equipment & Tools Recommendations

### Smartphone Photography
**Best for**: Daily progress, quick documentation, accessibility
**Advantages**: Always available, geo-tagging, auto-metadata
**Tips**: Clean lens before shooting, use grid overlay in camera app, consistent height (phone at eye level)

### DSLR / Mirrorless Camera
**Best for**: Quality inspection, detailed documentation, professional appearance
**Advantages**: Manual controls, consistent white balance, large sensor quality
**Tips**: Use tripod for consistency, manual focus for critical detail, RAW capture if available

### Measuring Scale Tools
**Requirements for every detail photo:**
- Folding measuring rule (2-3 meter preferred)
- Steel tape measure (25-30 feet)
- Level (for checking slope/plumb if documented)
- Pen/marker for scale markings

### Drone/UAS Equipment
**Requirements for aerial photos:**
- Part 107 licensed pilot
- Quality drone (DJI Air 3 or better)
- Flight log documentation
- Safety procedures and site NFZ coordination

### Photo Management Software
- **Phone**: Native gallery app with tagging capability
- **Computer**: Adobe Lightroom (organization + metadata), Windows Photos (tagging)
- **Cloud**: Google Drive, OneDrive (backup + sharing)

## Photo Metadata Essentials

### Mandatory Fields
1. **Date**: ISO format (2026-02-18)
2. **Category**: PROGRESS, QUALITY, SAFETY, WEATHER, DELIVERY, RFISUPPORT, SUBMITTAL, DEFICIENCY, ASBUILT, AERIAL
3. **Location**: Grid reference (A-1) OR building area (EastWing) OR room (Room 107)
4. **Description**: One sentence describing what's visible and why documented

### Strongly Recommended
5. **Trade**: Concrete, Steel, Drywall, Electrical, etc.
6. **Sub Contractor**: Name of performing entity
7. **Related Document**: RFI number, Punch ID, Submittal number (if applicable)
8. **Photographer**: Person who took photo (accountability)

### Optional But Useful
9. **Time**: Specific time taken (14:30)
10. **Weather**: Cloud cover, temperature, wind (for activity impact analysis)
11. **Consistency Note**: "Standard A-1 angle from northeast, 10 feet from building"
12. **Comments**: Any relevant context, issues, or notable findings

## Integration with Daily Report Workflow

### End-of-Day Photo Review Process

1. **Download photos** from camera/phone
2. **Review for quality** — reject blurry, duplicate, or non-conforming images
3. **Rename files** to standard convention if needed (automated scripts can help)
4. **Add metadata** — location, trade, category, description
5. **Organize in daily folder** (`/10 - Project Photos/2026-02-18/`)
6. **Update photo log** — add entries to photo-log.json with searchable fields
7. **Link to RFI/Punch/Submittal** — if photos support pending documents
8. **Select photos for daily report** — choose best 3-5 photos summarizing day's work
9. **Archive originals** — backup to cloud storage
10. **Communicate** — alert team lead if critical issues photographed (safety, deficiency, RFI)

### Daily Report Photo Summary
- **Count by category**: How many PROGRESS, QUALITY, SAFETY, etc.
- **Count by area/trade**: Which grids/areas documented
- **Notable findings**: Any items requiring follow-up
- **Missing coverage**: Areas that need documentation attention

---

## Legal & Contractual Considerations

### Photos Suitable for Dispute/Claim Documentation
- **Date/time stamped**: Original EXIF metadata intact
- **Photographed contemporaneously**: Taken on day of work (not retrofitted)
- **Unaltered originals**: No Photoshop or manipulation (except straightening/cropping)
- **Sequence documented**: Before/after pairs or progression clearly evident
- **Witness information**: Other personnel present identified if relevant
- **Location clearly marked**: Grid reference, room, or building area explicit

### Legal Defensibility Standards
- Preserve original files (forensic hash can be calculated)
- Backup to secure location (cloud or external drive)
- Maintain file naming consistency and folder structure
- Document any edits or reprocessing (e.g., "cropped for report")
- Do not delete or overwrite; maintain complete archive
- Keep 7-year retention minimum (per typical construction contracts)

### Limitations & Disclaimers
- Do not photograph competitor operations or proprietary information
- Obtain permission before photographing neighboring properties
- Avoid identifiable close-up facial photos (privacy risk)
- Check engineer/architect before photographing specialized equipment
- Maintain confidentiality of sensitive construction methods or security systems
