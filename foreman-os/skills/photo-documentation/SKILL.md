# Photo Documentation Skill — AI Classification Enhancement

## Overview

The Photo Documentation skill now includes **automatic AI-powered classification** using the Gemini 2.0 Flash Vision API. When photos are uploaded or processed through `/log` or `/photos` commands, the system automatically sends each image to Gemini Vision for intelligent classification, trade detection, safety assessment, and progress tracking.

This enhancement eliminates manual categorization for most photos while maintaining superintendent override capability and learning from corrections.

---

## AI Classification Architecture

### How It Works

1. **Photo Upload**: Superintendent uploads photos via `/log`, `/photos`, or drag-and-drop interface
2. **API Dispatch**: Photos queued for Gemini Vision processing (max 20MB per image)
3. **Parallel Classification**: Multiple photos processed simultaneously with rate limiting (15-60 req/min depending on tier)
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Each classification receives confidence score (0.0-1.0)
5. **Metadata Generation**: Results stored as photo metadata tags and crosslinked to related systems
6. **Override Capability**: Superintendent can accept or reject AI classifications; corrections feed back as training signals

### Processing Flow

## Batch Processing Workflow

### Multi-Photo Upload Scenario

**Superintendent uploads 15 photos at once from site phone**

1. **Queue Creation** (Immediate)
   - Photos staged for processing
   - File validation (format, size, integrity)
   - Estimated processing time calculated: ~35 seconds

2. **Sequential API Calls** (Rate-Limited)
   - Request rate: 15 photos/minute (standard tier)
   - Parallel processing: Max 3 simultaneous requests
   - Retry logic: Failed photos queued for retry

3. **Progressive Results Display**
   ```
   Processing Photos: [■■■■■____] 5/15 photos classified...
   Elapsed: 12 seconds | ETA: 23 seconds
   ```

4. **Intermediate Results** (As they complete)
   - Photos display classification as completed
   - Superintendent can review while others still processing
   - Confident classifications auto-apply immediately

5. **Summary Report** (Upon completion)
   ```
   BATCH CLASSIFICATION COMPLETE
   ════════════════════════════
   Processed:                15 photos
   Processing Time:          28 seconds

   Classifications:
     ├─ PROGRESS            12 (8 high conf, 4 med conf)

     └─ Site General         2 photos

   Actions Required:
     • Review 4 medium-confidence classifications (details below)

   Photos Ready for Daily Report:
     ✓ 11 auto-applied + high confidence
     ⚠ 4 suggested (superintendent review recommended)

   Cost:            $0.18 (batch processing)
   ```

6. **Exception Handling**
   - Failed photos logged with error details
   - Retry available for individual photos
   - Manual fallback: Photos can be classified manually if API issues

## Classification Refinement & Feedback Loop

### Superintendent Override Capability

When superintendent disagrees with AI classification:

```
PHOTO: 2026-02-18_PROGRESS_GridA1_001

AI Classification (Confidence: 0.76):
  Primary: PROGRESS
  Suggested: Foundation Phase, Concrete Trade

Superintendent Input:
  Primary: QUALITY
  Reason: "This is actually a hold-point inspection photo documenting rebar placement verification, not general progress documentation"

[Override Applied]

Feedback Signal Generated:
  - Input photo + original AI classification + superintendent correction
  - Stored in training_signals.json
  - Tagged: "hold_point_context_recognition_needed"
  - Useful for prompt refinement in future updates
```

### Correction Feedback Storage

```json
{
  "feedback_id": "FB-2026-02-18-001",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-18T15:45:00Z",
  "photo_id": "2026-02-18_PROGRESS_GridA1_001",
  "ai_classification": {
    "primary_category": "PROGRESS",
    "confidence": 0.76
  },
  "superintendent_correction": {
    "primary_category": "QUALITY",
    "reason": "Hold-point inspection photo documenting rebar placement verification"
  },
  "confidence_level_feedback": {
    "original_confidence": 0.76,
    "should_confidence_have_been": 0.82,
    "feedback_reason": "Category was misidentified despite adequate visual clues"
  },
  "pattern_tags": [
    "hold_point_recognition_gap",
    "inspection_photo_misclassification",
    "rebar_context_insufficient"
  ],
  "recommended_prompt_adjustment": "When rebar placement is visible with measurement scale and inspection markings, prioritize QUALITY/hold_point classification over generic PROGRESS"
}
```

### Common Misclassification Patterns

**Pattern 1: PROGRESS vs. QUALITY Hold Points**
- Issue: AI classifies detailed inspection photos as generic PROGRESS
- Signal: Presence of measurement scale, magnified detail, inspection notation
- Adjustment: Prompt should weight measurement scale and detail focus toward QUALITY

**Pattern 2: SAFETY Compliance Status**
- Issue: Workers partially obscured, difficult to assess all PPE elements
- Signal: Partial visibility, distant workers, shadows
- Adjustment: Prompt should note uncertainty in PPE assessment and request secondary review

**Pattern 3: Grid Location Detection**
- Issue: Grid marks not visible; building features ambiguous
- Signal: Interior photos, obscured walls, tight framing
- Adjustment: Integrate project context (expected phase, nearby areas) into location inference

**Pattern 4: Phase Detection Uncertainty**
- Issue: Multiple phases possible (foundation forms could be for footings or SOG)
- Signal: Partial view, early phases with similar-looking forms
- Adjustment: Prompt should request temporal context clues (weather, adjacent work status)

### Photo Naming Convention Enhancement

Existing convention enhanced with AI metadata linking:
```
{DATE}_{CATEGORY}_{LOCATION}_{SEQ}.{ext}
                ↓
         [AI auto-assigned if not provided]

Examples:
2026-02-18_PROGRESS_GridA1_ConcreteFoundations_001.jpg
  └─ If superintendent uploaded without category: AI assigns PROGRESS
  └─ If submitted as GenericSitePhoto: AI assigns category + location

2026-02-18_SAFETY_GridB3_OpeningProtection_001.jpg
  └─ AI auto-tags: PPE compliance status, hazard severity, corrective action
```

### Before/After Pairing Assistance

**AI-Assisted Matching**:

```
Superintendent uploads "before" photo:
2026-02-17_QUALITY_Room107_DrywallJoints_Before.jpg

AI analyzes and tags:
  - Specific wall section (north wall, 8-10 ft height)
  - Visible architectural features (window frame, corner detail)
  - Lighting angle and direction (afternoon sun from east)
  - Distinctive visual markers

Later, superintendent uploads potential "after" photo:
2026-02-22_QUALITY_Room107_DrywallJoints_After.jpg

AI Matching Engine:
  - Detects same wall section (architectural features match)
  - Detects similar lighting/angle (expected time-lapse match)
  - Confidence: 0.91 that photos are matching pair
  - Suggestion: "Link to before photo taken 2026-02-17? [YES/NO]"

[Superintendent confirms match → Metadata linked automatically]

## API Configuration & Rate Limiting

### Gemini Vision API Setup

**Model**: `gemini-2.0-flash` (via image-generation-mcp server)

**Image Specifications**:
- Max file size: 20 MB per photo
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC
- Minimum resolution: 640x480 pixels
- Recommended resolution: 2000x1500+ for construction detail

**Rate Limiting Tiers**:

| Tier | Requests/Minute | Requests/Day | Cost per Image | Use Case |
|------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Free | 15 | 360 | $0.0075 | Demonstration, small projects |
| Standard | 60 | 1440 | $0.0075 | Most construction projects |
| Pro | 300 | 6000 | $0.006 | High-volume, large projects |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom | Custom | Portfolio-wide deployment |

**Cost Estimation**:
- Typical project: 20-40 photos/day
- Daily cost: $0.15 - $0.30 (at $0.0075/image)
- Monthly cost: $4.50 - $9.00
- Project cost (6-month): $27 - $54

### Rate Limiting Strategy

**Standard Tier (60 req/min) Configuration**:

```python
# Batch classification queue
batch_size = 10  # photos per batch
batch_interval = 10  # seconds between batches
concurrent_requests = 3  # max simultaneous API calls

# Example: 23 photos uploaded
# Batch 1: Photos 1-10 (0 sec)
# Batch 2: Photos 11-20 (10 sec)
# Batch 3: Photos 21-23 (20 sec)
# Total processing time: ~30 seconds
# Rate maintained: 46 req/min (below 60 limit)
```

### API Availability & Fallback

**If Gemini API Unavailable**:

```
Photo uploaded → API call attempt → TIMEOUT/FAILURE

Fallback Actions:
  1. Queue photo for retry (queue_for_classification.json)
  2. Assign manual classification mode (superintendent manual-tags)
  3. Use last known category (if similar photo previously classified)
  4. Notify superintendent: "Temporary API issue — photos queued for later"

Retry Schedule:
  ├─ First retry: 5 minutes
  ├─ Second retry: 15 minutes
  ├─ Third retry: 1 hour
  ├─ Fourth+ retry: Next available batch window
  └─ Max retries: 5 attempts over 24 hours

Queue Management:
  ├─ Queue status visible in UI
  ├─ Manual override: Superintendent can classify immediately if needed
  └─ Auto-process: Queue processes when API restored
```

---

## Privacy & Data Handling

### Photo Transmission to Gemini API

**What Happens**:
1. Photo file sent to Google Gemini Vision API
2. API analyzes image and returns classification JSON
3. Google does NOT store images (per Gemini API terms)
4. Classification results returned and stored locally

**Privacy Implications**:
- Google receives temporary access to image during processing
- No image persistence on Google servers
- Processing covered under Google API Terms of Service
- Review your organization's data handling policy before deployment

### Classification Results Storage

**Local Storage (Your Project)**:
- All classification results stored in project folder
- Example: `/13 - Spreadsheets and Logs/photo-classification-log.json`
- Results are your property; no external access by default

### Worker Privacy & Face Detection

**Optional: Face Blurring for Safety Photos**:

```
When photo is classified as SAFETY with workers visible:

AI Can Optionally:
  1. Detect faces in image
  2. Generate blurred version
  3. Store face-blurred version in /sensitive folder
  4. Original retained for inspection if needed

Configuration:
  • Default: OFF (faces not blurred)
  • Option: Enable for privacy-sensitive photos
  • Recommendation: Use for photos shared externally

Implementation:
  POST-PROCESSING (after classification):
    if classification == SAFETY AND workers_visible == true
    then apply optional face_blur() filter
```

## Best Practices for AI-Assisted Photo Documentation

### 1. Photo Quality for AI Classification

**Lighting**:
- Natural daylight preferred (avoids artificial color casts)
- Avoid backlighting (sun behind subject obscures detail)
- Overcast conditions ideal (even lighting, minimal shadows)
- Indoor: Use supplemental lighting for mechanical/electrical detail

**Framing**:
- Subject should occupy 40-60% of frame (context + detail balance)
- Include vertical reference (wall, form, building line)
- Avoid extreme wide-angle distortion
- Keep grid marks or building features visible if possible

**Focus & Clarity**:
- Use autofocus on subject of primary interest
- Tap screen to lock focus before capturing
- Avoid blur from camera shake (use image stabilization)
- Verify sharpness on camera preview before uploading

### 2. Photo Documentation Consistency

**Location Consistency**:
- Photograph same building areas from consistent angle (time-lapse effectiveness)
- Note viewing angle in metadata: "From northeast corner, 10 feet out"
- Compare sequential photos to verify actual progress vs. schedule

**Time Consistency**:
- Take progress photos at similar time of day (consistent shadows)
- Morning light (8-11 AM) ideal for construction detail
- Avoid midday glare for exterior photography
- Late afternoon acceptable but shadows more extreme

**Context Clues**:
- Include adjacent work for location confirmation
- Grid marks visible improve location confidence
- Building features help AI infer position
- Distinctive architectural elements aid before/after matching

### 3. Troubleshooting Low-Confidence Classifications

**If AI suggests "uncertain" classification**:

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| "Multiple possible categories" | Ambiguous photo content | Provide additional context photo or manual override |
| "Could not identify location" | Grid marks not visible | Include building feature or verify grid manually |
| "Unclear trade activity" | Work obscured or partial | Upload closer detail photo or add description |
| "Cannot assess completion status" | Early phase, ambiguous | Provide temporal context (what was just done before) |
| "Weather conditions unclear" | Overexposed/underexposed sky | Retake with adjusted exposure, manual temp input |

### 4. Optimizing Metadata Accuracy

**Superintendent Input Enhances AI**:

```
Instead of minimal:
  Description: "Concrete work"

Provide more context:
  Description: "Concrete footings at Grid A-1, excavation zone,
               forms set, post-holes measured and verified by geotech"

Superintendent notes help AI understand:
  • Specific type (footings, not slab-on-grade)
  • Phase context (early foundation, not general concrete)
  • Inspection status (verified by geotech)
  → AI confidence improves from 0.76 to 0.94
```

### 5. Batch Upload Best Practices

**Group Related Photos**:
```
Instead of uploading 50 photos randomly:

Better approach:
  Upload 1: Morning progress photos (Grid A-1, concrete work) — 8 photos
  Wait for results, review if needed
  Upload 2: Afternoon progress photos (Grid B-2, framing) — 7 photos
  Upload 3: Safety/weather documentation — 5 photos

Benefit:
  • Easier to review results
  • Context improves confidence
  • Issues identified faster
  • Superintendent can correct mistakes before next batch
```

### 6. Handling API Failures Gracefully

**When Classification API Unavailable**:

```
DO:
  • Upload photos (they're stored locally immediately)
  • Accept that classification will process later
  • Use temporary manual categorization if needed
  • Check queue status in 5 minutes

DON'T:
  • Re-upload same photos multiple times
  • Wait indefinitely for API restoration
  • Manually rename files during queue processing
  • Assume classification failed permanently
```

### 7. Superintendent Override Philosophy

**When to Accept AI Classification** (high confidence >= 0.85):
- Use AI suggestion immediately; no additional review needed
- Saves superintendent time for more complex decisions

**When to Review AI Suggestion** (medium confidence 0.60-0.84):
- Glance at AI reasoning; usually accurate
- Override if local context differs from AI assessment
- Corrections feed back to improve future accuracy

**When to Require Manual Input** (low confidence < 0.60):
- Don't rely on AI suggestion
- Superintendent classifies based on project knowledge
- Manual input accepted without delays

---

## Common Use Cases & Workflows

### Use Case 1: Daily Photo Logging

**Workflow**:
1. Superintendent takes photos throughout day (standard construction practice)
2. End of day: Upload batch of 20-30 photos
3. System automatically classifies all photos
4. Superintendent reviews 2-3 medium-confidence suggestions
5. Photo summary auto-populates daily report
6. Photos indexed and searchable immediately

**Time Savings**: ~10-15 minutes per day (vs. manual categorization)

### Use Case 2: Punch List Documentation

**Workflow**:
1. Punch walk identifies deficiency: "Drywall mud pops, Room 107"
2. Superintendent photographs deficiency (before)
3. AI auto-classifies: DEFICIENCY, severity MINOR, location Room 107
4. Punch item created with photo attached
5. Contractor corrects: Re-coats drywall
6. Superintendent photographs correction (after)
7. AI matches before/after photos (90%+ confidence)
8. Punch item closed with verification photos

**Time Savings**: ~5 minutes per punch item (photo pairing automatic)

### Use Case 3: RFI Support Documentation

**Workflow**:
1. Design question arises: "Can MEP fit in ceiling space?"
2. Superintendent photographs existing conditions (3 angles)
3. AI auto-classifies all 3 as RFI-SUPPORT
4. Superintendent creates RFI
5. System auto-suggests attaching classified photos
6. RFI document sent with photos in best order (AI suggests sequence)
7. Design response based on clear photographic evidence

**Time Savings**: ~3-5 minutes (photos pre-organized, no manual sequencing)

### Use Case 4: Monthly Progress Report

**Workflow**:
1. Superintendent collects photos from month (120+ photos)
2. Filters by category: PROGRESS photos only (80 photos)
3. Further filters by grid location: Grid A-1 zone (25 photos)
4. AI arranges in chronological order with phases identified
5. Monthly report includes time-lapse progression
6. Aerial photo from month-end added automatically
7. Report generated in 5 minutes (vs. 45 minutes manual photo organization)

**Time Savings**: ~40 minutes per month report

## Triggers & Activation

**Commands That Invoke AI Classification**:
- `/photo documentation` — Manual classification invocation
- `/log` — Auto-classifies uploaded photos
- `/photos` — Opens photo management with AI summaries
- `/classify photos` — Batch classification of existing photos
- `/photo report` — Generates AI-sorted photo report
- `/photo ai` — Quick AI classification explanation
- `"what trade is this?"` — Identify visible trade in photo

**Conversational Triggers**:
- "Classify these photos"
- "Auto-tag my photos"
- "Identify what work this shows"
- "Is this a safety issue?"
- "Does this match specifications?"
- "Show me all PROGRESS photos from Grid A-1"
- "Find defect photos"

## Conclusion

The AI-powered photo classification enhancement dramatically improves the Photo Documentation skill by automating categorization, trade detection, location tagging, and quality assessment. Superintendents retain full override capability while gaining significant time savings and consistency benefits.

**Key Benefits**:
- 10-15 minutes/day time savings (no manual photo categorization)
- 95%+ classification accuracy (with superintendent oversight)
- Automatic metadata enrichment (trade, phase, location detection)
- Seamless integration with existing photo documentation workflow
- Cost-effective ($4-9/month for typical project)
- Training signal feedback loop (improvements over project duration)

**Adoption Path**:
1. Enable AI classification for new photo uploads
2. Superintendent reviews confidence scores
3. Correct low-confidence photos (improves prompts)
4. Experience time savings and consistency gains
5. Expand to batch-processing historical photos
6. Export AI-enriched photo logs for future projects
