# Subcontractor Performance Scorecard Skill for Foreman OS

## Overview

The sub-performance skill delivers objective, data-driven performance scorecards for every subcontractor on a project. Rather than relying on gut feelings or anecdotal feedback, scorecards aggregate actual project data across five critical performance dimensions, each scored 1-10 and weighted to produce a composite score.

### Purpose

Subcontractor performance scorecards enable:

1. **Informed Bidding Decisions**: When planning the next project, access historical performance data. Prefer subs with proven track records; avoid repeat problems.
2. **Back-Charge Documentation**: Performance data (quality failures, schedule misses, safety incidents) provides objective justification for back charges or warranty claims.
3. **Performance Improvement Conversations**: Instead of vague feedback ("Your crew wasn't organized"), use data: "Your PPC was 62% this quarter; the project average is 78%. Let's discuss what blocked your work."
4. **Contract Incentives**: Reward high-performing subs (9-10 rating) with priority on future bids, multi-project discounts, or bonus incentives.
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Flag at-risk subs (<5.0 rating) early; initiate corrective action meetings or contract review before problems cascade.
6. **Preferred Vendor Lists**: Build institutional memory across projects. Track sub performance over years; promote reliable, professional subs; deprioritize problematic ones.

### Scorecard Philosophy

The sub-performance scorecard is **objective, data-driven, and fair**. It:

- Pulls data automatically from daily reports, inspections, safety logs, and RFI records (not manual opinions)
- Uses transparent scoring criteria so subs understand what they're measured on
- Separates factors within a sub's control (quality, responsiveness, professionalism) from external factors (weather delays, supplier issues)
- Generates dialogue: "Your score is 6.8. Here's where you excelled and where you can improve."

## The Five Scoring Dimensions

Each dimension is scored 1-10, measured against objective criteria, and weighted in a composite formula.

### 1. Schedule Adherence (25% Weight)

**Definition**: Does the subcontractor complete committed work on time, maintain promised crew size, mobilize/demobilize on schedule, and hit project milestones?

#### Scoring Criteria

**90%+ PPC (Percent Plan Complete) = 10**
- Subcontractor completes commitments more than 90% of the time
- Minimal incomplete work; when incomplete, root cause is external (weather, owner delay, supplier)
- Crew size consistent with promises
- Mobilization on time; demobilization efficient

**80-89% PPC = 8**
- Subcontractor completes commitments 80-89% of the time
- Good reliability; occasional incomplete work (5-10 items per season)
- Crew size generally consistent
- Minor delays in mobilization/demobilization

**70-79% PPC = 6**
- Subcontractor completes commitments 70-79% of the time
- Marginal; noticeable delays and scope deferrals
- Crew size inconsistency (promised 4, shows 2-3)
- Mobilization delays or early demobilization without notice

**60-69% PPC = 4**
- Subcontractor completes commitments 60-69% of the time
- Poor; significant schedule impact on downstream trades
- Chronic crew size shortages or absences
- Frequent mobilization/demobilization issues

**<60% PPC = 2**
- Subcontractor completes commitments fewer than 60% of the time
- Unacceptable; project delays directly attributable to this sub
- Crew unavailable, undersized, or uncooperative
- Critical schedule milestones missed

#### Data Sources

- **PPC by Trade** from last-planner skill (calculated weekly)
- **Crew Counts** from daily reports (promised vs. actual headcount)
- **Milestone Dates** from schedule vs. actual completion dates
- **Mobilization/Demobilization Dates** from contract documents vs. field records

#### Calculation

```
Schedule Score = PPC × 1.0 (primary), adjusted ±0.5 for crew consistency and milestone performance
```

**Example (MOSC):**
- Walker Construction: PPC 87%, crew consistent, early mobilization = 8.5 → Score: 8 (round down)
- W Principles (Concrete): PPC 71%, crew undersized last 2 weeks, stem wall pour delayed 1 week = 6 → Score: 6

### 2. Quality (25% Weight)

**Definition**: Does the subcontractor produce work that passes inspection on first attempt, minimize punch list items, avoid rework, and maintain warranty standards?

#### Scoring Criteria

**First-Pass Inspection Rate (FPIR) 95%+ = 10**
- 95% or more of the sub's work passes inspection without corrections
- Punch list items <5 per 1,000 SF of work
- Rework frequency <2% of total work
- Post-completion warranty callbacks zero or minimal

**FPIR 90-94% = 8**
- 90-94% of work passes first inspection
- Punch list items 5-10 per 1,000 SF
- Rework frequency 2-3%
- Few warranty callbacks

**FPIR 85-89% = 6**
- 85-89% of work passes first inspection
- Punch list items 10-20 per 1,000 SF
- Rework frequency 3-5%
- Occasional warranty callbacks

**FPIR 80-84% = 4**
- 80-84% of work passes first inspection
- Punch list items 20-40 per 1,000 SF
- Rework frequency 5-8%
- Multiple warranty callbacks

**<80% FPIR = 2**
- Fewer than 80% pass first inspection
- Punch list items >40 per 1,000 SF
- Rework frequency >8%
- Recurring warranty failures

#### Data Sources

- **Inspection Tracker** from quality-management skill (pass/fail rates by trade, by phase)
- **Punch List Items** from punch-list skill (filtered by responsible trade)
- **Rework Log** from quality-management or daily-report-format (completed rework tasks)
- **Warranty Callback Records** from closeout and post-completion phase

#### Calculation

```
Quality Score = (FPIR base 1-10) + (Punch list adjustment ±1) + (Rework adjustment ±1) + (Warranty adjustment ±0.5)
```

**Example (MOSC):**
- EKD (CFS Framing/Drywall): FPIR 91%, punch list 8/1000 SF, rework 2%, zero callbacks = 8 + 0 + 0 + 0.5 = 8.5 → Score: 8
- Stidham Cabinets: FPIR 87%, punch list 15/1000 SF, rework 4%, 1 callback = 6 + 0 + (-0.5) + 0 = 5.5 → Score: 6

---

### 3. Safety (20% Weight)

**Definition**: Does the subcontractor maintain a safe worksite, train crews on safety procedures, comply with PPE and housekeeping standards, and avoid incidents?

#### Scoring Criteria

**Zero Recordable Incidents + Full Compliance = 10**
- No OSHA-recordable incidents (injuries requiring medical treatment beyond first aid)
- Zero near-miss events logged

- Consistent housekeeping scores (site clean, debris cleared, hazards mitigated)
- PPE compliance: Hard hats, safety glasses, hi-vis, steel-toe boots observed on all crew members every site visit
- Competent person certifications current (excavation, fall protection, scaffold)

**Zero Recordables + Minor Non-Compliance = 7**
- No recordable incidents
- 1-2 near-miss events (minor, quickly corrected)
- Toolbox talk attendance >90%
- Housekeeping good (occasional clutter, quickly cleaned)
- PPE compliance >95% (1-2 minor PPE lapses observed)
- Certifications current

**Minor Incidents + Non-Compliance = 4**
- 1 recordable incident (e.g., minor laceration, strain) during project
- 3-5 near-miss events
- Toolbox talk attendance 80-90%
- Housekeeping inconsistent (frequent debris, poor organization)
- PPE compliance 80-90% (repeated reminders needed)
- Certifications current but minimal training beyond requirements

**Serious Incidents or Chronic Non-Compliance = 1**
- Multiple recordable incidents (2+) or serious incident (hospitalization, lost-time injury)
- Chronic near-misses (6+) suggesting systemic safety culture problem
- Toolbox talk attendance <80%
- Poor housekeeping (chronic debris, tripping hazards, blocked exits)
- PPE non-compliance <80% (repeated violations despite warnings)
- Expired certifications or untrained crews

**Critical Safety Failure = 0**
- OSHA citation
- Willful safety violation
- Incident resulting in fatality or permanent disability
- Shut down by OSHA inspector
- Repeated violations after formal notice

#### Data Sources

- **Safety Management Records** from safety-management skill (incident log, near-miss reports)
- **Daily Site Observations** from daily-report-format (housekeeping notes, PPE compliance)
- **Toolbox Talk Log** from safety procedures (attendance by crew)
- **OSHA Records** (citations, inspections)
- **Safety Audit Scores** from project-wide safety audits

#### Calculation

```
Safety Score = Base (0-10) adjusted by incident severity and pattern analysis
```

**Example (MOSC):**
- Walker Construction: Zero recordables, 1 near-miss (remediated), toolbox talks 100%, housekeeping 95%, PPE compliance 100%, certs current = 10
- Davis & Plomin (HVAC): Zero recordables, zero near-misses, toolbox talks 95%, housekeeping good, PPE compliance 95%, certs current = 9 → Score: 9

### 4. Responsiveness (15% Weight)

**Definition**: How quickly does the subcontractor respond to RFIs, submit required documents, resolve issues, and communicate with the project team?

#### Scoring Criteria

**<3 Day Average RFI Response + <5 Day Submittal Turnaround = 10**
- RFI responses average <3 business days (questions answered in writing within 3 days)
- Submittals reviewed and returned with approval/corrections within 5 days
- All requested information provided on first submission (no back-and-forth delays)
- Communication clear, complete, professional
- Proactive issue resolution: Sub flags potential problems before they escalate

**3-5 Day RFI Response + 5-7 Day Submittal = 8**
- RFI responses average 3-5 business days
- Submittals turnaround 5-7 days
- Minor information gaps requiring 1-2 follow-up requests

- Information gaps or incomplete submissions requiring clarification
- Communication adequate but sometimes unclear
- Reactive: Issues addressed after they become critical

**7-14 Day RFI Response + 10-14 Day Submittal = 4**
- RFI responses average 7-14 business days
- Submittals turnaround 10-14 days
- Frequent incomplete submissions; multiple follow-ups required
- Communication poor; difficult to reach, vague responses
- Slow issue resolution; delays cascade to downstream work

**>14 Day RFI Response + >14 Day Submittal = 2**
- RFI responses >14 days or no response without escalation
- Submittals overdue; extended back-and-forth delays
- Consistently incomplete submissions; requires constant chasing
- Communication unreliable; poor responsiveness
- Issues unresolved for weeks; impacts project schedule

#### Data Sources

- **RFI Log** from rfi-preparer skill (date issued → date answered, tracked per trade)
- **Submittal Tracking** from submittal-intelligence skill (date received → date approved, by supplier)
- **Communication Records** (email response times, meeting attendance, call logs)
- **Issue Resolution Log** (tickets opened → closed, time-to-resolve)

#### Calculation

```
Responsiveness Score = (RFI response time score 1-10) + (Submittal turnaround score 1-10) / 2
+ (Communication quality manual score 1-10) / 3
```

**Example (MOSC):**
- Schiller (Doors/Hardware): RFI avg 12 days, submittal avg 24 days (OVERDUE), communication poor = 3 + 2 + 2 / 3 ≈ 2.3 → Score: 2
- Alexander (PEMB): RFI avg 2 days, submittal avg 4 days, communication clear, proactive = 10 + 10 + 9 / 3 ≈ 9.7 → Score: 10

- **Daily Report Observations** (crew conduct, site cleanliness, cooperation notes)
- **Incident Reports** (conflicts, complaints filed by other trades or owner)
- **Document Compliance Tracking** (insurance certificates, licenses, submittals timeliness)
- **Change Order Audit** (reasonableness of requests, fairness of negotiations)
- **Owner/Architect Feedback** (site visits, correspondence, satisfaction comments)

#### Calculation

```
Professionalism Score = Superintendent manual rating (primary, 1-10) + adjustments based on incident/compliance records (±0-1)
```

**Example (MOSC):**

## Composite Score Calculation

Once all five dimensions are scored 1-10, combine using this weighted formula:

```
COMPOSITE SCORE = (Schedule × 0.25) + (Quality × 0.25) + (Safety × 0.20)
                  + (Responsiveness × 0.15) + (Professionalism × 0.15)
```

### Rating Scale

| Composite Score | Rating | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9.0-10.0 | **Excellent** | Preferred Bidder | Recognition, incentives, preferred bid list |
| 7.0-8.9 | **Good** | Standard Operations | Continue; monitor annually |
| 5.0-6.9 | **Needs Improvement** | At Risk | Performance meeting; improvement plan; increased monitoring |
| <5.0 | **At Risk** | Critical | Formal corrective action; contract review; potential termination |

### Scorecard Example: MOSC Project

**Walker Construction (Excavation/Sitework)**
- Schedule (PPC 87%): 8.5 → 8
- Quality (FPIR 93%, punch list 6/1000 SF): 8
- Safety (zero recordables, 100% compliance): 10
- Responsiveness (RFI avg 2 days, clear communication): 9
- Professionalism (excellent crew conduct, clean, cooperative): 9
- **Composite = (8 × 0.25) + (8 × 0.25) + (10 × 0.20) + (9 × 0.15) + (9 × 0.15) = 2.0 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 1.35 + 1.35 = 8.7**
- **Rating: GOOD** ✓

**W Principles (Concrete - Self-Perform)**
- Schedule (PPC 71%, crew undersized): 6
- Quality (FPIR 88%, punch list 14/1000 SF): 6
- Safety (zero recordables, 95% compliance): 9
- Responsiveness (RFI avg 4 days, timely submittals): 8
- Professionalism (crew adequate, occasional cleanup issues): 7
- **Composite = (6 × 0.25) + (6 × 0.25) + (9 × 0.20) + (8 × 0.15) + (7 × 0.15) = 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.8 + 1.2 + 1.05 = 7.05**
- **Rating: GOOD** ✓

**Schiller (Doors/Hardware)**
- Schedule (PPC cannot assess — material/supply; apply default 5 for supplier reliability): 5
- Quality (FPIR pending; apply default 5): 5
- Safety (N/A — no onsite crew; rate 5 default): 5
- Responsiveness (RFI avg 12 days, submittal avg 24 days OVERDUE): 2
- Professionalism (insurance on file, but poor communication): 5
- **Composite = (5 × 0.25) + (5 × 0.25) + (5 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.15) + (5 × 0.15) = 1.25 + 1.25 + 1.0 + 0.30 + 0.75 = 4.55**
- **Rating: AT RISK** ✗
- **Action: Formal corrective action letter sent 02/18/26. Require daily submittal status updates. Consider alternate supplier for future work.**

## Performance Actions by Score Level

Each rating tier triggers specific actions designed to reinforce excellence, support improvement, or escalate risk.

### Excellent (9.0-10.0)

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Public Recognition**
   - Feature in monthly project newsletter or social media
   - Superintendent commendation letter sent to sub company leadership
   - Announce safety/quality milestone publicly on site

2. **Preferred Bidder List**
   - Add to company's preferred vendor list for future projects
   - Priority bid invitation on next comparable project
   - Multi-project contract discounts (e.g., 2-3% on next 2-3 projects)

3. **Contract Incentives**
   - Bonus eligibility for on-time completion (if applicable): 0.5-1% of contract value
   - Safety incentive: $500-$1,000 bonus for zero recordables through project completion
   - Quality incentive: $250-$500 bonus if punch list <10 items and first-pass rate >95%

4. **Business Development**
   - Testimonial request for company marketing materials
   - Reference for other general contractors
   - Consideration for self-perform scope on future GC projects

**Communication Approach:**
- Positive, collaborative tone
- Highlight specific achievements (e.g., "Your 87% PPC and zero safety incidents have earned recognition")
- Discuss future partnership opportunities

---

### Good (7.0-8.9)

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Standard Operations**
   - Continue current work pace and procedures
   - No formal corrective action needed
   - Annual performance review at project closeout

2. **Monitoring**
   - Track PPC weekly; flag if drops below 75% for discussion
   - Monitor quality metrics; address any upward trend in punch list items
   - Continue routine safety audits

3. **Optional Development**
   - Offer improvement suggestions in next performance review (e.g., "Responsiveness is solid at 8/10; consider even tighter RFI turnaround target of <2 days")
   - Invite to project improvement initiatives (e.g., Lean, prefabrication pilots)

**Communication Approach:**
- Positive, balanced tone
- "Your scorecard shows solid, reliable performance. We appreciate your professionalism and partnership."
- Frame improvement suggestions as optional growth opportunities, not mandates

---

### Needs Improvement (5.0-6.9)

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Performance Meeting (Scheduled within 7 days of rating)**
   - Super, PM, and sub leadership meet in person
   - Review scorecard in detail; explain scoring methodology
   - Discuss specific blockers: "Your PPC is 71%, which is below project average of 78%. What's blocking your work?"
   - Ask for root cause analysis: Is it labor, material, design, or external constraints?

2. **Improvement Plan (30-day document)**
   - Sub submits written 30-day improvement plan addressing each weak dimension
   - Goals: "Increase PPC to 78% by 03/31", "Reduce punch list rate to <10/1000 SF", etc.
   - Identify resources needed: additional crew, training, procurement support
   - Assign accountability (sub superintendent or PM point-person)

3. **Increased Monitoring**
   - Weekly (not just EOW) touchbase with sub foreman
   - More frequent site inspections for quality (2x/week instead of weekly)
   - Safety audits increased (weekly instead of monthly)
   - RFI/submittal response times tracked daily

4. **Escalation Trigger**
   - If scorecard doesn't improve to 6.5+ by end of 30-day period, escalate to formal corrective action letter

**Communication Approach:**
- Professional, supportive tone
- "Your scorecard shows opportunity for improvement. Let's work together to identify and remove blockers."
- Treat as collaborative problem-solving, not punishment
- Provide resources (crew training, material expediting support) if within GC's control

---

### At Risk (<5.0)

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Formal Corrective Action Letter**
   - Issued immediately upon <5.0 rating
   - Specifies performance deficiencies: "Responsiveness score 2/10 (RFI turnaround 12 days vs. project standard 3 days); Schedule score 4/10 (PPC 62% vs. project average 78%)"
   - Sets 10-day requirement to respond in writing with corrective action plan
   - States contractual consequences: "Failure to achieve improvement may result in work stoppage, contract termination, or back charges for delay damages"

2. **Immediate Intervention Meeting**
   - General Contractor leadership (PM, VP, or Principal) meets with sub company leadership
   - Format: firm, professional, solution-oriented
   - Clear timeline: "By [date], we need to see documented improvement in [specific areas]. We will re-score on [date]."
   - Establish daily communication cadence (super to sub foreman, daily huddle, no excuses)

3. **Contract Review**
   - PM reviews contract for termination clauses
   - Document all deficiencies as breach of contract
   - Evaluate financial and schedule impact of replacement sub
   - Assess liquidated damages claim or back-charge opportunity

4. **Replacement Sub Procurement**
   - Simultaneously source replacement sub (if termination is likely)
   - Establish acceleration clause: replacement sub can start immediately with overlap period
   - Plan transition to minimize schedule impact

5. **Daily Escalation Monitoring**
   - Daily scorecards submitted by sub foreman (checklist format)
   - Daily review by Super and PM
   - Weekly re-scoring of critical dimensions (Schedule, Responsiveness)
   - Open constraint log every day (any blockers?)

6. **Second Scorecard (10 days post-letter)**
   - Re-score all dimensions
   - If improvement to 5.0-6.0 range: Continue intensive monitoring; 2nd 30-day improvement plan
   - If no improvement or decline: Proceed to contract termination

**Communication Approach:**
- Firm, professional, serious tone
- Clear documentation and paper trail
- No ambiguity: "Here is what we need to see; here is when; here are the consequences."
- Remain respectful, but leave no doubt about seriousness of situation

**Example Corrective Action Letter:**

```
TO:         [Sub Company] Superintendent [Name]
DATE:       February 28, 2026
PROJECT:    Morehead One Senior Care (MOSC-825021)
SUBJECT:    FORMAL CORRECTIVE ACTION NOTICE — Performance Deficiency

Dear [Name]:

This letter is formal notice of performance deficiencies on the MOSC project, as documented in the Subcontractor Performance Scorecard dated 02/28/2026.

PERFORMANCE DEFICIENCIES:

Dimension              Score    Project Standard   Variance
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Responsiveness        2/10     8/10               CRITICAL
Schedule Adherence    4/10     7.5/10             CRITICAL
Professionalism       4/10     7/10               CRITICAL
Quality               5/10     7.5/10             Significant
Safety                7/10     8.5/10             Marginal
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COMPOSITE             4.5/10   7.2/10             AT RISK

SPECIFIC ISSUES:

1. Responsiveness: RFI response time averaging 12 days vs. project standard of 3 days.
   Door/hardware submittals overdue 24 days as of 02/28/2026. This delay is blocking
   downstream trades and threatening project schedule.

2. Schedule Adherence: PPC 62% vs. project average 78%. Crew size inconsistent with
   commitments; promised 5, showing 2-3. Two weekly commitments deferred mid-week without
   notice.

3. Professionalism: Multiple incidents of poor site coordination; crew leaving debris
   and blocking MEP staging area. Insurance documentation incomplete (liability cert
   missing 10 days past due date).

REQUIRED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:

By March 10, 2026 (10 days), submit written Corrective Action Plan addressing:

1. RFI Turnaround: Commit to 3-day response by March 10. Submit daily RFI status
   report (due 4 PM daily) starting March 3.

2. Submittal Processing: Commit to all door/hardware submittals complete and approved
   by March 5. Identify expediting resources (additional staff, supplier escalation).

3. Schedule Adherence: Increase crew size to promised 5 personnel by March 3. Commit
   to weekly PPC target of 80%+ starting week of March 3.

4. Insurance/Compliance: Submit missing documentation by March 3. Commit to all
   paperwork on time and complete going forward.

5. Site Management: Assign dedicated crew member to daily site cleanup (6:00 AM
   before work start, 4:00 PM after work). Super will verify compliance daily.

CONSEQUENCES:

Failure to demonstrate sustained improvement by March 17, 2026 (2-week checkpoint)
may result in:
- Work stoppage until corrective action demonstrated
- Contract termination for cause per Section [X] of subcontract
- Back charges for delay damages and re-mobilization costs
- Removal from future bid lists

NEXT STEPS:

1. This letter received and acknowledged by you by COB February 29, 2026 (email signature).
2. Corrective Action Plan submitted by March 10, 2026.
3. Re-scoring meeting scheduled for March 17, 2026 at 8:00 AM on site.

We value your company and partnership. We are committed to supporting you in meeting
project standards. However, current performance is unacceptable and must improve immediately.

Please confirm receipt of this letter and your commitment to the corrective action plan.

Sincerely,

John Smith
Superintendent
W Principles General Contracting

## Subcontractor Pre-Qualification Criteria

Pre-qualification is the process of evaluating a subcontractor's capability, financial strength, safety record, and experience BEFORE inviting them to bid on a project. Pre-qualification reduces risk by filtering out subs who lack the capacity, track record, or financial stability to perform the work reliably.

### Financial Capacity

Financial capacity determines whether a sub can fund the work (labor, materials, equipment) between progress payments and absorb the cash flow impact of retainage.

- **Annual Revenue**: Sub's annual revenue should be at least 2x the anticipated subcontract value. A sub with $500K annual revenue bidding on a $400K subcontract is overextended.
- **Net Worth**: Sub's net worth (assets minus liabilities) should exceed 50% of the anticipated subcontract value. Projects exceeding 50% of the sub's net worth represent a financial risk flag — the sub may not have sufficient reserves to fund the work if payment delays occur.
- **Risk Flag**: If the subcontract value exceeds 50% of the sub's net worth, the sub is at elevated financial risk. Require additional bonding or financial guarantees, or consider an alternate sub.
- **Financial Statement Availability**: Request audited or reviewed financial statements (last 2-3 years). Compiled statements are acceptable for smaller subs. Tax returns are a minimum if formal financials are unavailable.

### Bonding Capacity

Bonding capacity demonstrates that a surety company has evaluated the sub's financial strength and is willing to guarantee their performance.

- **Single Project Limit**: The maximum bond the surety will issue for a single project. The subcontract value must be within this limit.
- **Aggregate Limit**: The total bonding capacity across all active projects. If the sub is already bonded on multiple projects near their aggregate limit, they may not have capacity for your project.
- **Bonding Company Rating**: The surety company should be rated A- or better by AM Best. Sureties rated below A- may have insufficient financial strength to pay claims.
- **Bond Types**: Performance bond (guarantees completion) and payment bond (guarantees payment to sub-subs and suppliers). Both should be available if required by contract.

### Safety Record

Safety performance is a leading indicator of overall management quality. Subs with poor safety records often have poor quality and schedule performance as well.

- **EMR (Experience Modification Rate)**:
  - EMR is calculated by the sub's workers compensation insurance carrier based on actual claims history vs. expected claims for the sub's industry classification
  - EMR < 1.0 = better than industry average (GOOD)
  - EMR < 0.75 = significantly better than average (EXCELLENT)
  - EMR > 1.0 = worse than industry average (CAUTION)
  - EMR > 1.5 = significantly worse than average (DISQUALIFYING for many GCs)
  - Request 3-year EMR history to assess trend

- **TRIR (Total Recordable Incident Rate)**:
  - Number of OSHA-recordable injuries per 200,000 hours worked
  - Industry average varies by trade; residential construction ~4.0, commercial ~3.0
  - Target: Below industry average for the sub's trade classification
  - Request 3-year TRIR history

- **DART Rate (Days Away, Restricted, or Transferred)**:
  - Measures severity of injuries (not just frequency)
  - Lower DART = less severe injuries and faster return to work
  - Target: Below industry average for trade classification

### Experience

Experience on projects of similar type, size, and complexity is one of the strongest predictors of performance.

- **Similar Project Type**: Has the sub completed projects of the same type (healthcare, senior living, education, industrial, retail)? Healthcare and senior living have unique regulatory requirements (life safety, infection control, ADA compliance) that subs without experience may not understand.
- **Similar Project Size**: Has the sub completed projects of similar dollar value and physical scope? A sub experienced with $50K projects may struggle to manage a $500K scope.
- **Geographic Familiarity**: Is the sub familiar with local building codes, inspection requirements, labor markets, and weather conditions? Out-of-state subs may underestimate local conditions.
- **Years in Business**: Minimum 3 years in continuous business operation. New companies (<3 years) have higher failure rates and less established management systems.

### References

- **Minimum 3 Recent Projects**: Request references from 3 projects completed within the last 3 years that are similar in scope to the proposed work.
- **Contact Information**: Owner or GC project manager name, phone, and email for each reference.
- **Reference Check Questions**: Did the sub complete on time? Within budget? Quality of work? Safety record? Responsiveness? Would you hire them again?

### Workforce

- **Key Personnel Proposed**: Identify the project superintendent, foreman, and any specialized personnel (e.g., certified welders, licensed electricians) who will be assigned to the project. Evaluate their experience and tenure with the sub.
- **Skilled Labor Availability**: Does the sub have access to sufficient skilled labor to staff the project? Are they union or non-union? Do they have an apprenticeship program?
- **Self-Perform Capability**: What percentage of the work will the sub self-perform vs. sub-subcontract? Subs who self-perform more work generally have better quality control.

### Backlog

- **Current Committed Work**: What other projects is the sub currently working on? What is the total value of committed work?
- **Capacity to Take on New Project**: Does the sub have sufficient management bandwidth and labor capacity to take on the proposed project without overextending?
- **Schedule Availability**: Can the sub's proposed key personnel be available for the project's anticipated start date and duration?

- 4: Good key personnel; adequate labor; self-perform 60-80%
- 3: Acceptable personnel; may need to supplement labor; self-perform 40-60%
- 2: Key personnel untested; labor concerns; heavy sub-subcontracting
- 1: No identified key personnel; labor shortage; entirely sub-subcontracted

**References (10%)**:
- 5: All references highly positive; would rehire enthusiastically; on-time, on-budget, high quality
- 4: References mostly positive; minor issues noted; would rehire
- 3: Mixed references; some concerns noted; would rehire with conditions
- 2: References raise concerns; schedule or quality issues; would not rehire without reservations
- 1: Negative references; significant problems reported; would not rehire

**Insurance/Legal (5%)**:
- 5: All insurance meets or exceeds requirements; no litigation; no surety claims; no terminations
- 4: Insurance meets requirements; minor past litigation resolved; no surety claims
- 3: Insurance adequate; some past disputes; no active litigation
- 2: Insurance gaps; active or recent litigation; surety claim filed
- 1: Insufficient insurance; multiple active lawsuits; surety claims; past terminations

### Qualification Thresholds

- **Minimum Qualifying Score**: 3.5 weighted average. Subs scoring below 3.5 are not invited to bid.
- **Preferred Qualification**: 4.0+ weighted average. Subs scoring 4.0 or above are placed on the preferred bidder list.

### Automatic Disqualifiers

The following conditions result in automatic disqualification regardless of overall score:

1. **EMR > 1.5**: Safety record too poor to allow on jobsite. Insurance costs will be excessive.
2. **Active Litigation Against the GC**: Conflict of interest prevents fair working relationship.
3. **No Bonding Capacity**: If the contract requires bonding and the sub cannot obtain bonds, they cannot perform.
4. **License Not Current**: Working without a current, valid contractor's license is illegal and creates liability exposure.
5. **Insufficient Insurance**: If the sub cannot meet the project's minimum insurance requirements, they cannot work on site.
6. **False Information on Questionnaire**: Any materially false statement on the pre-qualification questionnaire is grounds for immediate disqualification and permanent removal from bid lists.

## Integration Points

The sub-performance skill integrates with multiple Foreman OS skills to pull data and enable workflows.

### 1. last-planner Skill
**Data Flow**: PPC by Trade → Schedule Adherence Score
- Last planner calculates PPC (Percent Plan Complete) for each sub weekly
- sub-performance pulls PPC into Schedule Adherence dimension
- Subs with PPC >85% earn 9-10 score; subs <60% earn 2-4
- Pareto analysis of PPC variances (prerequisites, material, labor) feeds performance discussion

**Example**:
- Last Planner calculates: Walker Construction 87% PPC this week
- sub-performance updates: Walker schedule score = 8 (based on 87% PPC)
- If Walker maintains >85% PPC for 4 weeks, trend shows stability

---

### 2. inspection-tracker / quality-management Skill
**Data Flow**: First-Pass Inspection Rate (FPIR), Punch List Items → Quality Score
- Quality-management tracks inspections by trade (pass/fail)
- sub-performance pulls FPIR = (inspections passed) / (total inspections) × 100
- Punch list skill provides items per 1000 SF by responsible trade
- Rework log tracks completed rework by sub

**Example**:
- Quality-management: EKD (Drywall) — 14 of 15 inspections passed = 93% FPIR
- sub-performance: Quality score = 8 (based on 93% FPIR, 6 punch list items/1000 SF, 2% rework)

---

### 3. safety-management Skill
**Data Flow**: Incidents, Near-Misses, Housekeeping, PPE Compliance → Safety Score
- Safety-management logs recordable incidents, near-misses, safety audits
- sub-performance pulls incident count and severity
- Toolbox talk attendance, housekeeping scores, PPE observations feed safety rating
- Zero recordables + 100% compliance = 10; incidents drop score to 3-7

**Example**:
- Safety-management: Walker Construction — zero recordables, zero near-misses, 5 toolbox talks, 100% attendance, housekeeping avg 95%
- sub-performance: Safety score = 10 (perfect record)

### 4. rfi-preparer Skill
**Data Flow**: RFI Response Times → Responsiveness Score
- RFI preparer logs RFI issued date and response received date
- sub-performance calculates average response time per trade
- <3 day avg = 10; 3-5 days = 8; 5-7 = 6; 7-14 = 4; >14 = 2

**Example**:
- RFI Log: Walker issued 4 RFIs; responded in 1, 1, 2, 2 days (avg 1.5 days)
- sub-performance: Responsiveness score = 10 (RFI portion) due to excellent turnaround

---

### 5. submittal-intelligence Skill
**Data Flow**: Submittal Turnaround Times → Responsiveness Score
- Submittal-intelligence tracks date received, date reviewed, date approved, date returned
- sub-performance calculates turnaround = (date approved - date received)
- <5 days = 10; 5-7 = 8; 7-10 = 6; 10-14 = 4; >14 = 2

**Example**:
- Submittal Log: Schiller doors/hardware submitted 01/20, approved 02/13 = 24 days
- sub-performance: Responsiveness score = 2 (critical delay)

---

### 6. daily-report-format Skill
**Data Flow**: Crew Counts, Work Completion, Observations → Schedule, Professionalism, Safety
- Daily reports document crew headcount (promised vs. actual)
- Work completion status (task complete, in progress, blocked)
- Observations (crew conduct, site cleanliness, blockages)
- sub-performance aggregates across 4+ weeks to assess trends

**Example**:
- Daily reports (4 weeks): W Principles promised 4-person crew; actual 2-3. Crew showed 75% consistency.
- sub-performance: Schedule score adjusted downward for crew inconsistency (from 8 to 6)

---

### 7. project-dashboard Skill
**Integration**: Sub Scorecard Section with Radar Charts
- Project dashboard displays sub performance summary (all subs, composite scores)
- Radar chart visualization of 5 dimensions for each sub (visual at-a-glance assessment)
- Trend indicators (↑↓→ showing direction)
- Color-coded status (green/yellow/red)

**Example Dashboard Widget**:
```

### 8. pay-application Skill
**Integration**: Performance Data Supports Back-Charges
- Pay-app skill processes sub invoices and GC back-charges
- sub-performance data links quality failures, schedule delays, safety incidents to back-charge documentation
- Example: Sub quality score 4/10 with punch list 50/1000 SF → GC back-charges sub for rework labor

**Example**:
- Stidham Cabinets invoice: $25,000 for cabinet installation
- sub-performance quality: 4/10 (FPIR 82%, punch list 35/1000 SF = rework needed)
- GC applies back-charge: $1,500 (6% of contract value) for rework labor and inspection
- Pay-app shows: Invoice $25,000 - Back-charge $1,500 = Final pay $23,500

| Axis | Walker | W Principles | Schiller |
|---|---|---|---|
| Schedule (25%) | 8/10 (100%) | 6/10 (75%) | 5/10 (63%) |
| Quality (25%) | 8/10 (100%) | 6/10 (75%) | 5/10 (63%) |
| Safety (20%) | 10/10 (100%) | 9/10 (90%) | 5/10 (63%) |
| Responsiveness (15%) | 9/10 (90%) | 8/10 (80%) | 2/10 (20%) |
| Professionalism (15%) | 9/10 (90%) | 7/10 (70%) | 5/10 (63%) |

**Visualization**: Radar chart shows Walker as a "full pentagon" (balanced excellence), W Principles as slightly dented on responsiveness, Schiller severely dented on responsiveness (narrow spike).

## Back-Charge Documentation

Performance data provides objective foundation for back-charge claims.

### Back-Charge Categories

**1. Quality Back-Charges**
- Rework labor: Sub's punch list items require GC labor to remediate
- Inspection time: Excessive inspection cycles due to high failure rate
- Warranty callbacks: Post-completion rework for sub's deficiencies
- Documentation: "Stidham Cabinets punch list: 12 items; GC labor to correct: 16 hrs @ $75/hr = $1,200 back-charge"

**2. Schedule Back-Charges**
- Delay damages: Sub's low PPC causes downstream delays; GC incurs extended supervision, equipment rental
- Acceleration cost: GC must pay for expedited labor/material to recover schedule lost to sub
- Documentation: "W Principles concrete schedule delays (50% PPC) caused 3-week delay to PEMB erection; extended super cost 3 weeks × $150/day = $3,150 back-charge"

**3. Safety Back-Charges**
- Safety remediation: Sub's inadequate safety practices require GC to hire safety officer or remediate hazards
- Incident costs: Sub caused incident; GC absorbs medical, workers comp, reporting costs
- Documentation: "Walker excavation near-miss (utility strike) caused 1-day shutdown; GC paid for utility locating, investigation, re-training: $800 back-charge"

**4. Responsiveness Back-Charges**
- Expediting costs: Sub's slow RFI response causes design delays; GC pays for expediting or re-work
- Coordination labor: GC super spends excessive time chasing sub for approvals/submissions
- Documentation: "Schiller submittals overdue 24 days delayed door installation schedule; GC incurred 20 hrs coordination labor: $1,500 back-charge"

### Back-Charge Documentation Workflow

1. **Scorecard Triggers Back-Charge Review**: When sub scores <6.0 on any dimension, PM reviews back-charge opportunities
2. **Document Supporting Evidence**: Daily reports, inspection records, RFI logs, timesheets
3. **Calculate Damages**: Labor hours × rate, equipment rental extended, material acceleration costs
4. **Prepare Back-Charge Letter**: Formal notice citing specific deficiencies and calculated damage
5. **Link to Pay-Application**: Back-charge deducted from next sub invoice
6. **Dispute Resolution**: Sub can dispute back-charge with supporting evidence; escalate if contested

### Example Back-Charge Memo

```
BACK-CHARGE NOTICE
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TO:         Schiller Doors & Hardware
FROM:       John Smith, Superintendent, W Principles GC
DATE:       February 28, 2026
PROJECT:    Morehead One Senior Care (MOSC-825021)
SUBJECT:    Back-Charge for Submittal Processing Delays

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SCOPE OF BACK-CHARGE:

Schiller's performance scorecard dated 02/28/2026 reflects critical delays
in submittal processing:

  Responsiveness Score: 2/10
  RFI Response Time: 12 days (project standard: 3 days)
  Submittal Turnaround: 24 days overdue (standard: 5 days)
  Impact: Door/hardware installation schedule blocked; downstream trades delayed

COST BREAKDOWN:

1. Superintendent Expediting Labor
   Dates: 02/10 - 02/28 (4 weeks)
   Labor: Escalation calls, follow-up emails, coordination meetings
   Time: 20 hours @ $75/hour (Superintendent T&M rate)
   Cost: $1,500

2. Schedule Delay Impact
   Delay Period: 02/10 - 02/28 (18 days overdue)
   GC Extended Supervision: 18 days × $150/day (Super onsite cost)
   Cost: $2,700

TOTAL BACK-CHARGE: $4,200

JUSTIFICATION:

Schiller's submittals are contractually required within 5 days of receipt
for GC review and approval. 24-day delay (vs. standard 5 days) is 4.8x
baseline and represents material breach of contract duty.

GC's back-charge reflects actual labor expended to expedite and
mitigate schedule impact. This is consistent with contract § 7.2
(Contractor's Right to Recover Costs Incurred Due to Sub's Deficiency).

RESOLUTION:

GC proposes:
Option 1: Schiller accepts back-charge; deducted from next progress payment
Option 2: Schiller disputes back-charge in writing by 03/07/2026; parties
          meet to review supporting documentation and negotiate settlement

Contact John Smith (john.smith@w-principles.com / 606-555-1234) to discuss.

Sincerely,

John Smith
Superintendent, W Principles GC

## End-of-Project Evaluation

At project closeout, conduct final comprehensive scorecard for each sub to build institutional memory and inform future bidding.

### Final Scorecard Process (Post-Substantial Completion)

1. **Compile Full-Project Data** (Weeks 1 - Substantial Completion)
   - All PPC data by trade across entire project
   - Complete inspection history (FPIR)
   - Final punch list (closeout items)
   - Warranty callback data (if available; extend for 30-day post-completion)
   - Safety record (full project, zero-incident or documented incidents)
   - RFI/submittal complete history
   - Contract compliance audit

2. **Conduct Final Performance Meeting** (1 week before final payment)
   - Super, PM, and sub leadership meet for 1-hour review
   - Present final scorecard (all five dimensions)
   - Discuss strengths, challenges, and lessons learned
   - Gather sub's feedback: "What did we do well? What could we improve?"
   - Document meeting minutes

3. **Calculate Final Composite Score**
   - Use same weighted formula: (Schedule 0.25) + (Quality 0.25) + (Safety 0.20) + (Responsiveness 0.15) + (Professionalism 0.15)
   - Final rating: Excellent (9+), Good (7-8.9), Needs Improvement (5-6.9), At Risk (<5)

4. **Store Final Scorecard in Project Archive**
   - File location: Project files, "03 - Subcontractors / [Sub Name] / FINAL SCORECARD"
   - Include: All data, charts, photos, correspondence
   - Timestamp: Completion date, evaluators' signatures

5. **Add to Company Preferred Vendor Database**
   - Extract final scorecard to centralized vendor database
   - Include project name, dates, final score, and superintendent notes
   - Track across multiple projects for trend analysis (does sub improve over time?)

## Best Practices for Fair, Objective Subcontractor Evaluation

To ensure scorecards remain objective, transparent, and effective:

### 1. Use Data, Not Opinions
- **Measure facts**: PPC (from last-planner), FPIR (from inspections), RFI response times (from RFI log)
- **Avoid gut feelings**: Don't rate "overall quality" without FPIR or punch list data
- **Document sources**: Every score point to a data source (daily report, inspection record, RFI log)
- **Avoid personality bias**: Rate the sub's work performance, not whether you like their foreman

### 2. Weight Dimensions Fairly
- Five dimensions (25%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 15%) reflect industry best practice
- Schedule and Quality equally weighted (50% total) because both critical to project success
- Safety heavily weighted (20%) because safety is non-negotiable
- Responsiveness and Professionalism (30% combined) support collaboration
- Adjust weights if project-specific priorities differ (e.g., heavy on Quality for precision manufacturing assembly)

### 3. Calibrate Scoring Thresholds
- Define specific, measurable thresholds for each score level (1-10)
- Example: "PPC 90%+ = 10; 80-89% = 8; 70-79% = 6" — not ambiguous
- Publish thresholds to all subs at project start so expectations are clear
- Calibrate against industry norms and project baselines

### 4. Separate Performance from Blame
- **Variance analysis**: Assign variance categories (Prerequisites, Material, Labor, etc.) to understand root cause
- **Not always the sub's fault**: If a sub's PPC is low due to supplier delays (Material variance), don't penalize Schedule score unfairly
- **Example**: W Principles concrete PPC = 62%. Root cause: 60% of incomplete work = "Prerequisites" (prior phases not complete). Adjustment: Don't lower Schedule score for externally-caused delays; instead note "W Principles responding appropriately to dependencies."

### 5. Transparency and Communication
- **Publish methodology**: Share scoring rubric with all subs at project start
- **Share scorecards regularly**: Monthly or phase-end scorecard shared with sub leadership (not just Internal GC review)
- **Explain scores**: When sharing scorecard, walk through the evidence: "Your PPC is 71% (6/10 score) because you completed 7 of 10 commitments. These two were deferred due to material delay (not your fault); these three due to labor/crew size."
- **Open dialogue**: Invite sub input: "Do you disagree with this assessment? Here's the data we're using. What are we missing?"

### 6. Consistency Across Subs and Projects
- **Use same rubric for all subs**: Every trade (excavation, concrete, framing, MEP) scored using same 5 dimensions and thresholds
- **Compare within trade**: A mechanical sub's PPC is compared to other mechanical subs, not to excavation subs (different work types have different reliability profiles)
- **Track across projects**: If a sub scores 8.2 on Project A and 6.1 on Project B, investigate: Did sub's management change? Was Project B more complex? Does sub have a learning curve on new scopes?

### 7. Avoid Retroactive Judgment
- **Capture data in real time**: Don't wait until project end to assess performance; document weekly
- **Weekly snapshots**: Calculate dimensional scores weekly so subs see trends and can course-correct
- **No surprises**: Final scorecard should confirm the running assessment, not introduce new information
- **Example**: At week 4, tell sub "Your schedule score is 6/10; PPC is 68%. Here's your trend. Let's discuss how to improve." Don't wait until final scorecard to say "You're at 5/10, below our standard."

### 8. Provide Feedback and Development Opportunity
- **Coaching mindset**: Scorecards are tools for improvement, not just judgment
- **Performance meetings**: For subs scoring 5-6.9 (Needs Improvement), offer support: "Your PPC is low. What constraints are blocking your work? Can we help expedite material? Add crew?" Don't just say "Do better."
- **Recognize improvement**: Track trends; celebrate subs who score 6.0 in week 2 but 7.5 by week 8
- **Example**: "Davis & Plomin, your safety score went from 7/10 to 9/10 after implementing our suggested toolbox talk format. Excellent response to feedback."

### 9. Document and Archive
- **Centralized database**: Store all scorecards (per-project, per-sub) in accessible location
- **Historical tracking**: Track sub performance over 3-5 projects; look for patterns (does sub improve over time? Maintain excellence? Decline?)
- **Preferred vendor management**: Subs with 3+ projects at 8.0+ composite score → Preferred Bidder list; subs with 2+ projects below 5.0 → Do Not Bid list
- **Institutional learning**: Use database to inform future bidding: "Walker averaged 8.6 across 3 projects; Schiller averaged 5.1 across 2 projects."

### 10. Balance Accountability with Partnership
- **Accountability**: Scorecards hold subs to clear standards; low scores trigger corrective action
- **Partnership**: Approach as collaborative problem-solving, not adversarial
- **Long-term relationships**: Good subs become repeat partners; you benefit from continuity, institutional knowledge, team chemistry
- **Example tone**: Not: "Your performance is unacceptable; we're replacing you." Better: "Your scorecard shows challenges; let's solve these together so you can succeed on future work."

## Summary

The sub-performance scorecard skill transforms subcontractor evaluation from informal, opinion-based judgment to objective, data-driven assessment. By measuring five critical dimensions (Schedule, Quality, Safety, Responsiveness, Professionalism) against transparent criteria, the skill enables:

- **Informed bidding decisions** backed by track record data
- **Fair performance conversations** grounded in evidence, not personalities
- **Early intervention** for at-risk subs before problems cascade
- **Recognition and incentives** for excellent subs
- **Back-charge documentation** supported by objective performance data
- **Institutional memory** across projects and years
- **Continuous improvement** through feedback and coaching

Implemented consistently, sub-performance scorecards elevate project quality, schedule reliability, safety, and team professionalism while building long-term vendor relationships with proven, capable partners.
