### Substantial Completion vs Final Completion

**Substantial Completion:**
- Work sufficiently complete for owner to occupy and use for intended purpose
- Triggers: warranty start date begins, liquidated damages cease accruing, owner takes possession, retainage typically reduced by 50%
- Owner may use space while contractor completes punch list items
- Owner responsible for property insurance and utilities
- Contractor maintains security and incomplete work protection

**Punch List Period:**
- Period between substantial and final completion (typically 30-60 days)
- Contractor completes all punch list items identified at substantial completion inspection
- May include re-testing and re-commissioning of affected systems
- Back-charges assessed for incomplete items or owner-caused damage

**Final Completion:**
- ALL work complete including punch list items
- ALL closeout documents submitted and approved by owner/PM
- ALL retainage released after final inspection
- Project formally closed in accounting systems
- Warranty period documented and starts (if not already from substantial)

**Timeline:**
- Typically 30-60 days from substantial to final completion
- Some extended systems (roofing warranty testing) may extend closure
- Final inspection required before certification

## Commissioning Tracking

### Systems Commissioning Workflow

**Pre-Functional Testing (PFT):**
- Verify equipment installed correctly according to manufacturer specifications
- Verify all controls wired per design documents
- Verify all utilities (power, water, gas, drainage) connected and operational
- Visual inspection complete before energizing or starting equipment
- Documentation: checklist signed off by contractor and commissioning agent

**Functional Performance Testing (FPT):**
- System operates through all operational modes (normal, startup, shutdown, economy, emergency, seasonal)
- System meets performance criteria specified in design documents
- Response to setpoint changes verified
- Alarm and alert functions tested
- Safety interlocks and shutdown sequences tested
- Documentation: test results recorded with data logging where applicable

**Integrated Systems Testing:**
- Systems work together as designed (fire alarm triggers HVAC shutdown, elevator recalls, pressurization sequences, etc.)
- Building automation system sequences tested through actual conditions or simulation
- Emergency procedures tested (generator auto-start, load transfer, fuel supply)
- Documentation: system interaction matrix with test results

**Seasonal Testing:**
- May require summer/winter testing for HVAC systems to verify control response in both seasons
- Chiller operation versus boiler operation transition
- Economizer function in summer and winter modes
- Humidity control verification across seasons
