## Notes for Superintendent

- **Key Dependencies:** O&M manuals must be started early to allow time for contractor input; as-built drawings follow during inspection; training and commissioning happen near substantial completion
- **Coordination Required:** Multiple trade contractors and subcontractors must coordinate their closeout deliverables; superintendent must track all deadlines
- **Owner Communication:** Weekly status reporting recommended during punch list period; owner occupancy decisions impact contractor schedules
- **Documentation:** All test reports, commissioning results, and warranty documentation must be organized and indexed for long-term owner archiving
- **Critical Path:** TAB completion, commissioning approvals, and final inspections drive final completion date
