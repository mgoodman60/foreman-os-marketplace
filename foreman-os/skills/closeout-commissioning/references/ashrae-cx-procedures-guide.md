# ASHRAE Commissioning Procedures Guide

## Reference Document for Closeout & Commissioning Skill

This guide provides detailed reference procedures, templates, and criteria for implementing the ASHRAE Guideline 0 commissioning process on construction projects. It supplements the main SKILL.md by providing ready-to-use templates and deeper procedural detail.

## CxA Selection Criteria and Qualifications

### Minimum Qualifications

The Commissioning Authority should meet the following minimum qualifications:

**Experience Requirements:**
- Minimum 5 years of direct commissioning experience (not just HVAC design or construction)
- Minimum 3 completed projects of similar scope and complexity
- Experience with the specific building types on the project (healthcare, laboratory, office, etc.)
- Familiarity with local codes and AHJ requirements

**Certifications (one or more preferred):**
- ACG (ASHRAE Commissioning Group) Commissioning Process Management Professional (CPMP)
- BCA (Building Commissioning Association) Certified Commissioning Professional (CCP)
- NEBB Certified Commissioning Authority
- AEE (Association of Energy Engineers) Certified Building Commissioning Professional (CBCP)

**Technical Competencies:**
- HVAC system design and operation (all system types on the project)
- Building automation systems (BACnet, LON, proprietary systems)
- Electrical systems (power distribution, emergency power, lighting controls)
- Plumbing systems (domestic water, sanitary, storm)
- Fire protection systems (alarm, suppression, integration)
- Energy code compliance (ASHRAE 90.1, local energy code)
- LEED requirements (if pursuing LEED certification)

### Independence Requirements

| Project Type | CxA Independence Requirement |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| LEED Fundamental Cx (EAp1) | Cannot be employee of design firm, but can be employee of contractor |
| LEED Enhanced Cx (EAc1) | Must be independent of both design and construction teams; engaged directly by owner |
| Non-LEED (best practice) | Should be independent of installing contractors; may be part of design team if separate from system designers |
| Government/DOD | Per contract specification — often requires full independence |

### CxA Evaluation Criteria

When selecting a CxA, evaluate based on:

### Issue Resolution Workflow

```
ISSUE RESOLUTION PROCESS

   CxA Identifies Issue
         │
         ▼
   Log in Issues Database
   (all fields populated, photos attached)
         │
         ▼
   Assign Priority (Critical / Major / Minor)
         │
         ▼
   Notify Responsible Party
   (through superintendent or directly per contract)
         │
         ▼
   Responsible Party Acknowledges
   (confirms receipt and proposed resolution approach)
         │
         ▼
   Correction Performed
   (contractor makes the repair/adjustment)
         │
         ▼
   Contractor Notifies CxA
   (correction complete, ready for verification)
         │
         ▼
   CxA Verifies Correction
   (re-inspection, re-test, or documentation review)
         │
         ├── Pass → Issue Closed (status = Closed, date verified)
         │
         └── Fail → Issue Remains Open
                     (update description, new deadline assigned)
                     (return to "Correction Performed" step)
```

## Commissioning vs. Traditional Quality Control Comparison

| Aspect | Traditional QC/QA | Commissioning (Cx) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Focus** | Was it installed correctly per plans? | Does it perform per the Owner's Project Requirements? |
| **Timing** | During and after installation | Entire project lifecycle (pre-design through post-occupancy) |
| **Who leads** | Contractor's QC manager, architect during CA visits | Independent Commissioning Authority (CxA) |
| **Testing** | Visual inspection, code compliance checks | Functional Performance Testing under all operating modes |
| **Documentation** | Punch list, inspection reports | OPR, BOD, Cx Plan, FPT procedures, Issues Log, Cx Report |
| **Design review** | Not typically included | CxA reviews design for alignment with OPR |
| **Training** | Often informal or undocumented | Formal, documented, verified training program |
| **Post-occupancy** | Warranty callbacks | Seasonal testing, 10-month review, MBCx |
| **Integration** | System-by-system acceptance | Cross-system integration testing |
| **Owner involvement** | Minimal until turnover | Owner defines OPR, participates in Cx throughout |

| Economizer not functioning | Very common | Actuator not connected, sensor failed, sequence error | Reconnect actuator, replace sensor, correct BAS programming |
| SAT not meeting design | Common | Dirty coil, low refrigerant, incorrect staging | Clean coil, charge refrigerant, correct staging sequence |
| Unoccupied setback not working | Common | Schedule not programmed, override stuck on | Program BAS schedule, clear manual override |
| Excessive simultaneous heating/cooling | Common | Dead band too narrow, conflicting zone sensors | Widen dead band, recalibrate sensors, review sequences |
| Minimum OA not meeting code | Very common | Damper not opening to correct position, OA measurement inaccurate | Adjust minimum damper position, recalibrate sensor |
| VFD not modulating | Common | VFD in hand/manual mode, BAS signal not connected | Switch to auto, connect analog output from BAS |
| Condensate drain issues | Common | Trap not installed, drain pitched incorrectly | Install P-trap, re-pitch drain line |

### Controls Findings

| Finding | Frequency | Typical Root Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Sensor reading inaccurate | Very common | Poor sensor location, not calibrated, wrong sensor type | Relocate, calibrate, or replace sensor |
| Sequence of operations not matching design | Common | Programming error, design intent unclear | Correct BAS programming, clarify with design engineer |
| Alarms not configured | Common | Alarm limits not programmed, notification not set up | Configure alarm limits and notification routing |
| Trend logging not enabled | Very common | Not set up during programming, insufficient BAS memory | Enable trending, expand memory if needed |
| Network communication failures | Occasional | Wiring error, addressing conflict, protocol mismatch | Correct wiring, resolve address conflicts, verify protocol |

### Electrical Findings

| Finding | Frequency | Typical Root Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Emergency lighting battery test fails | Common | Batteries aged during construction, charger not connected | Replace batteries, verify charger operation |
| Generator transfer time exceeds spec | Occasional | ATS settings incorrect, generator warm-up delay | Adjust ATS time delay settings |
| Lighting controls not per spec | Common | Occupancy sensor timeout wrong, daylight sensor uncalibrated | Adjust settings, calibrate sensors |
| Panel directory incomplete/inaccurate | Very common | Not updated after changes during construction | Update directories to match as-built conditions |

### Fire Protection Findings

| Finding | Frequency | Typical Root Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| HVAC shutdown on alarm incomplete | Common | Not all units programmed for shutdown, wiring incomplete | Complete wiring, verify all units respond |
| Smoke damper does not close | Occasional | Actuator not connected, damper binding | Connect actuator, free damper mechanism |
| Stairwell pressurization out of range | Common | Fan speed incorrect, leakage paths | Adjust fan speed or damper, seal leakage paths |
| Fire pump jockey pump short-cycling | Occasional | Pressure settings too close, system leak | Adjust start/stop pressures, find and repair leak |
