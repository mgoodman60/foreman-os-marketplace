## PEMB-Specific Special Inspections

Pre-Engineered Metal Building (PEMB) requires specialized inspections per AWS D1.1 and manufacturer specs:

| Type | Tolerance | Requirement | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Anchor Bolt | ±1/8" | Location & elevation | Grid reference, hold-down torque verification |
| High-Strength Bolt | ±1/32" | Proper tension | Calibrated wrench, bolt grade certification |
| Moment Connection | ±1/4" | Beam-to-column welds | 100% visual + UT inspection required |

**Special Inspection IDs:** INSP-PEMB-001, INSP-PEMB-002, etc.

## Auto-Linking Intelligence

The inspection-tracker skill automatically links inspections to project intelligence:

### Schedule Activity Linking
Query project intelligence for schedule activities matching inspection date and type:
- "Concrete Pour Day" → auto-link to concrete pre-placement inspection
- "Steel Erection Week 3" → auto-link to structural steel inspection
- "Electrical Rough-In Phase" → auto-link to electrical inspection

### Hold Point Linking
Cross-reference spec hold points from project spec database:
- Inspection type matched to standard hold point (HP-02, HP-05, etc.)
- Override if project-specific hold point defined
- Display linked hold point ID to superintendent

### Specification Section Linking
Auto-populate CSI specification section reference:
- Foundation → 3.1.1
- Concrete → 3.2.1
- Structural Steel → 5.1.1
- Electrical → 16.0.0

## Re-Inspection Workflow

When inspection result = `fail`:

1. **Create Re-Inspection Entry:**
   - Auto-generate new INSP ID (sequential)
   - Set type as "{Original Type} (Re-inspection)"
   - Set `related_to` field to original inspection ID
   - Suggest date 48 hours after deficiency notification

2. **Track Deficiencies:**
   - Collect detailed deficiency descriptions
   - Log which contractor responsible for correction
   - Reference section of spec violated
   - Attach photos of deficiency

3. **Notification:**
   - Alert responsible trade contractor
   - Flag in morning brief
   - Include in daily report until re-inspection passed

4. **Closure:**
   - Log re-inspection result
   - Document corrective action taken
   - Release hold if pass
   - Create additional re-inspection if still fail

## Permit Tracking & Expiration Alerts

**Auto-Alert Thresholds:**
- **30 days to expiration:** Yellow flag in status report; suggest renewal inquiry
- **7 days to expiration:** Red flag; escalate to project manager
- **Expired:** Red flag; mark status as `expired`; notify responsible party

**Renewal Workflow:**
- Track date application submitted for renewal
- Update status to `renewed` upon reissuance
- Maintain continuous permit coverage throughout project

## Integration Points

### Morning Brief (`/morning-brief`)
Display under "Inspections & Permits" section:
- Upcoming inspections (next 24 hours) — show type, time, location, inspector
- Overdue inspections (no result logged) — Red flag with days overdue
- Permits expiring within 30 days — Yellow alert with days remaining

### Look-Ahead Schedule (`/look-ahead`)
Include scheduled inspections in weekly look-ahead:
- Inspections integrated by date into weekly view
- Show impact on critical path if hold point inspection
- Cross-reference with material delivery/contractor schedule
- Highlight PEMB special inspections with bold/asterisk

### Daily Report (`/daily-report`)
Section: "Inspections Today"
- Scheduled inspections for the day (time, type, location, inspector)
- Completed inspections from previous day (result, notes summary)
- Pending re-inspections affecting schedule
- Permit status reminder (expiring within 14 days)

## Error Handling & Validation

- **Duplicate Re-inspection:** Warn if re-inspection already exists for same deficiency
- **Invalid Inspector:** Log "External Inspector" if not in approved list; alert PM
- **Missing Linked Activity:** Alert if schedule activity cannot be found; allow manual entry
- **Permit Conflict:** Warn if inspection scheduled outside permit scope
- **Date Validation:** Reject inspection scheduled before permit issued
- **Status Consistency:** Prevent result logging if status ≠ `scheduled`

## Triggers & Voice Commands

- "Schedule an inspection"
- "Log inspection INSP-042"
- "Show inspection status"
- "What inspections are overdue?"
- "Upcoming inspections?"
- "Schedule a rebar inspection for Monday"
- "Inspection failed — need re-inspection"
- "Track permits"
- "When does the building permit expire?"
- "Special inspection — anchor bolts"
- "Healthcare inspection — state health dept"

## Safety Incident Tracking & Investigation

The safety incident tracking system captures all project injuries, near-misses, property damage, and environmental incidents. This module integrates incident documentation, root cause analysis, corrective action tracking, and OSHA compliance management.

### Incident Data Model

{
  "incidents": [
    {
      "id": "INC-001",
      "date": "2026-02-18",

        "contributing_factors": ["Housekeeping", "Incomplete re-inspection"]
      },
      "corrective_actions": [
        {
          "action": "Re-inspect all rebar caps in active pour areas daily",
          "responsible": "GC Superintendent",
          "due_date": "2026-02-19",
          "status": "open | in_progress | complete | verified"
        }
      ],
      "osha_recordable": false,
      "reported_to": ["Safety Director", "Project Manager"],
      "photos": [],
      "status": "open | under_investigation | corrective_actions_pending | closed"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Incident Fields:**
- `id`: Unique incident identifier (INC-NNN format)
- `date`: Date incident occurred (ISO 8601)
- `time`: Time of incident (HH:MM format)
- `type`: Incident classification (injury, near_miss, property_damage, environmental, fire, utility_strike)
- `severity`: Severity level for OSHA classification (first_aid, medical_treatment, lost_time, fatality, near_miss)
- `location`: Specific job site location (grid reference, room, building area)
- `description`: Detailed narrative of what happened (sequence of events, conditions, outcome)
- `injured_party`: Object with worker info (name, company, trade) — null if near-miss or no injury
- `witnesses`: Array of witness names and roles (e.g., "Jane Doe — GC Superintendent")
- `immediate_action`: Actions taken immediately after incident (first aid, emergency response, work stop)
- `root_cause_analysis`: Object with method, findings, and contributing factors
- `corrective_actions`: Array of corrective action items with responsible party, due date, and status
- `osha_recordable`: Boolean; true if meets OSHA recordable criteria (determined per OSHA 300 rules)
- `reported_to`: Array of parties notified (Safety Director, Project Manager, OSHA if required, owner)
- `photos`: Array of incident scene photos (time-stamped)
- `status`: Current incident status (open, under_investigation, corrective_actions_pending, closed)

### Near-Miss Tracking

Near-misses use the same data model as injuries but with severity = "near_miss" and no injured_party required.

**Critical for Prevention**: Near-misses are leading indicators of systemic safety issues. Organizations with strong near-miss reporting programs typically have 10 near-misses reported for every 1 recordable incident.

**Near-Miss Attributes:**
- `description`: What could have happened if luck hadn't intervened (potential injury severity)
- `corrective_actions`: Even though no injury occurred, implement controls to prevent future occurrence
- `reporting`: Actively solicit near-miss reports in toolbox talks and safety briefings
- `trending`: Monthly summary of near-miss reports by category (dropped objects, electrical hazards, etc.)

**Reporting Encouragement:**
- Make near-miss reporting easy (no blame culture)
- Publicly acknowledge and implement near-miss suggestions
- Track and report near-miss statistics in safety meetings
- Use near-misses to guide safety priorities

### Root Cause Analysis Methods

#### 5-Why Analysis

Ask "why" repeatedly (minimum 3 levels, typically 5) to drill down from symptom to root cause:

```
Incident: Worker stepped on unsecured rebar cap

Why 1: Why did worker step on the rebar cap?
Answer: Worker was unfamiliar with the work area layout after formwork was adjusted

Why 2: Why was worker unfamiliar with the area?
Answer: Area was re-inspected and cleaned, but no re-briefing conducted after change

Why 3: Why was no re-briefing conducted?
Answer: Work crew wasn't notified that formwork was adjusted and area hazards changed

Why 4: Why wasn't crew notified?
Answer: GC superintendent adjusted formwork during shift change; communication breakdown

Why 5: Why did communication breakdown occur?
Answer: No formal change notification protocol in place for mid-shift modifications
```

**Root Cause (Why 5)**: Lack of formal change notification protocol for formwork modifications.

#### Fishbone (Ishikawa) Analysis

Categorize contributing factors into six major categories:

```
                               Incident (Rebar Cap Injury)
                                      |
        ┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─┴──────────┬─────────────┬──────────────┐
        │             │             │            │             │              │
     PEOPLE      EQUIPMENT      MATERIALS     METHODS      ENVIRONMENT    MANAGEMENT
        │             │             │            │             │              │
   • Unfamiliar  • No warning   • Caps not    • No re-brief  • Layout       • No protocol
     with layout   devices        secured       after change   changed         for changes
   • Distracted  • Formwork        after work  • No inspection • Lighting     • Poor comms
   • Lack of      damaged          modification  after modification           • No hazard
     PPE check

FINDINGS:
- People: Worker lacked area briefing
- Equipment: Warning devices insufficient
- Materials: Rebar cap security inadequate
- Methods: No re-inspection after modification
- Environment: Changed physical layout not communicated
- Management: No protocol for mid-shift changes
```

**Root Cause Clusters**: Methods + Management (no protocol, no re-inspection, no communication)

### OSHA Recordkeeping Rules

#### OSHA 300 Recordable Criteria

**NOT RECORDABLE (First Aid Only):**
- Band-aids, bandaging, gauze wrapping
- Cleaning wound with soap and water
- Ice pack application
- Non-prescription medication (aspirin, ibuprofen)

#### OSHA 300 Log Maintenance

Required for all U.S.-based construction projects:

```json
{
  "osha_300_log": {
    "project_name": "Morehead Construction Project",
    "project_year": 2026,
    "total_hours_worked": 0,  // Updated daily
    "recordable_incidents": 0,
    "lost_time_incidents": 0,
    "logs": [
      {
        "case_number": "1",
        "employee_name": "John Smith",
        "job_title": "Ironworker",
        "incident_date": "2026-02-18",
        "incident_description": "Stepped on unsecured rebar cap, foot puncture",
        "outcome": "medical_treatment",
        "days_away": 0,
        "days_restricted": 0,
        "days_transferred": 0,
        "osha_recordable": true,
        "injury_type": "puncture_wound",
        "body_part": "foot",
        "source": "rebar_cap"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Annual OSHA 300A Summary:**
- Posted February 1 - April 30 each year
- Summary of prior calendar year incidents
- Must display at job site
- Certification by company officer required

**Key Metrics for OSHA 300:**
- **Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR)**: (Recordable incidents × 200,000) / Total hours worked
- **Days Away, Restricted, or Transferred (DART) Rate**: (DART cases × 200,000) / Total hours worked
- **Lost Workday Case Rate**: (Lost time cases × 200,000) / Total hours worked

### Corrective Action Tracking

Each incident generates corrective actions to prevent recurrence:

**Corrective Action Object:**
```json
{
  "action": "Re-inspect all rebar caps in active pour areas daily",
  "responsible": "GC Superintendent",
  "due_date": "2026-02-19",
  "status": "open | in_progress | complete | verified",
  "notes": "Implemented during morning toolbox talk. All crews briefed.",
  "verification_date": "2026-02-19",
  "verified_by": "Safety Director"
}
```

**Tracking Workflow:**
1. **Open**: Action created; responsible party notified
2. **In Progress**: Party begins implementing the action
3. **Complete**: Action completed; documented in status record
4. **Verified**: Safety director confirms action was actually implemented and effective

**Leading Indicators (Safety Leading Indicators):**
- % of corrective actions completed on schedule
- Avg. time from incident to corrective action completion
- Repeat incidents (same type, same location) indicate ineffective corrective actions

### Safety Metrics for Dashboard

#### Primary Safety Metrics

**Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR)**
```
TRIR = (Recordable incidents × 200,000) / Total hours worked

Example: 2 recordable incidents, 100,000 hours worked
TRIR = (2 × 200,000) / 100,000 = 4.0 per 200,000 hours
Industry benchmark (construction): 3.0 - 4.5
```

**Days Away, Restricted, or Transfer (DART) Rate**
```
DART Rate = (DART cases × 200,000) / Total hours worked

Measures: Incidents resulting in lost time, restricted duty, or job transfer
More severe than TRIR (subset of recordables)
```

#### Leading Indicators (Predictive)

- **Safety Observations Completed**: # of daily safety observation rounds (target: 1/day/superintendent)
- **Toolbox Talks Held**: # of daily safety briefings (target: 1/day)
- **Hazard Reports Filed**: # of near-misses, safety concerns reported (target: 10:1 ratio with recordables)
- **Corrective Actions Completed On Time**: % of corrective actions meeting due date
- **Safety Training Completed**: % of workers with required certifications current
- **PPE Compliance**: % of workers observed wearing required PPE

#### Near-Miss Trending

**Target Ratio**: 10 near-misses reported for every 1 recordable incident (10:1 ratio)

```
This week:
- Near-misses filed: 8
- Recordable incidents: 1
- Ratio: 8:1 (below target)

Action: Increase hazard reporting awareness; conduct near-miss training
```

### Integration with Project Daily Systems

#### Storage Location

Incidents stored in `{{folder_mapping.config}}/inspection-log.json` under new `incidents` array:

```json
{
  "inspection_log": [...],
  "incidents": [...]  // New array for incident records
}
```

#### Morning Brief Integration

**Incidents & Safety Section:**
- **Open Incidents**: List INC IDs with status, type, date
- **Pending Corrective Actions**: Show overdue actions (due_date < today)
- **Yesterday's Incidents**: Summary of new incidents reported in past 24 hours
- **Near-Miss Summary**: Count of near-misses filed in past 7 days
- **OSHA Recordables YTD**: Running count with TRIR calculation

Example morning brief snippet:
```
INCIDENTS & SAFETY
[Red] INC-001: Rebar cap puncture wound (2026-02-18) — Corrective actions due 2026-02-19
[Yellow] Pending corrective actions: 2 (1 overdue)
Last 24h: 1 near-miss filed (electrical hazard, near-miss ratio 8:1)
OSHA Recordables YTD: 2 incidents, TRIR = 4.0
```

#### Daily Report Integration

**Incident Tracking Section:**
- Note any incidents that occurred during the report period
- Reference corrective actions underway
- Safety observations conducted during day
- Hazard reports or concerns raised by crews

### Compliance & Legal Considerations

**OSHA Compliance Checklist:**
- ✓ 300 Log maintained and updated timely (by employer)
- ✓ 300A Summary posted Feb 1 - Apr 30 (if 10+ employees)

- ✓ Privacy case list maintained (if required)
- ✓ Annual OSHA 301 forms completed (if recordable)
- ✓ Reporting to OSHA within 24 hours of serious incidents
- ✓ No retaliation for incident reporting

**Best Practices:**
- Investigate ALL incidents, not just recordables
- Document investigation thoroughly (photos, witness statements, RCA findings)
- Keep incident records confidential unless subject employee requests
- Maintain corrective action audit trail
- Report OSHA-recordables accurately and timely
- Use incidents to drive continuous safety improvement
