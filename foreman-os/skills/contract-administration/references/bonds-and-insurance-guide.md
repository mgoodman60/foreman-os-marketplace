# Bonds and Insurance Field Guide

## Overview

This reference covers the two financial safety nets in construction: bonds and insurance. Bonds guarantee performance and payment. Insurance covers losses from accidents, property damage, and errors. The superintendent's job is to verify coverage, enforce requirements, and know when to escalate issues.

This guide provides comparison tables, verification checklists, and decision matrices so you can make quick, informed decisions on site.

## Bond Types Comparison Table

| Feature | Bid Bond | Performance Bond | Payment Bond | Maintenance Bond |
|---------|----------|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Purpose** | Guarantees contractor will enter contract if awarded | Guarantees contractor will complete the work | Guarantees payment to subs, suppliers, and laborers | Guarantees correction of defects during warranty |
| **Typical Amount** | 5-10% of bid | 100% of contract value | 100% of contract value | 10-25% of contract value |
| **Who Requires It** | Owner in bid documents | Owner (or GC for sub bonds) | Owner (or GC for sub bonds) | Owner |
| **Who Is Protected** | Owner (against bid withdrawal) | Owner/GC (against non-completion) | Subs, suppliers, laborers | Owner (against defective work) |
| **Duration** | Bid validity period only (60-120 days typical) | Contract duration + warranty period | Contract duration + claim filing period | Warranty period (1-2 years typical) |
| **Triggered By** | Contractor refuses to enter contract after low bid | Contractor fails to complete work per contract | Non-payment to eligible claimants | Defective work discovered during warranty |
| **Claim Window** | During bid validity period | Varies -- typically during and shortly after construction | 90 days (federal) to 1 year after last furnishing | During warranty period |
| **Cost to Contractor** | Included in bid bond premium | 0.5-3% of bond amount annually | Usually combined with performance bond premium | 0.5-1% of bond amount |

### Bond Premium Cost Guidelines

Bond premiums are based on the contractor's financial strength, experience, and the project's risk profile.

| Contract Size | Typical Premium Rate (Performance + Payment) | Example Premium |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| $0 - $500K | 2.5 - 3.0% | $12,500 - $15,000 on $500K |
| $500K - $2.5M | 1.5 - 2.5% | $25,000 - $62,500 on $2.5M |
| $2.5M - $10M | 1.0 - 2.0% | $50,000 - $200,000 on $10M |
| $10M - $50M | 0.75 - 1.5% | $150,000 - $750,000 on $50M |
| $50M+ | 0.5 - 1.0% | $500,000+ on $100M |

Rates are approximate and vary by surety, contractor qualifications, and project risk.

## Performance Bond -- Detailed Coverage and Triggers

### What Triggers a Performance Bond Claim

The obligee (owner or GC) can make a claim when:

1. **Contractor has been declared in default** per the contract's termination provisions
2. **All contractual cure notice procedures have been followed** and documented
3. **The default is material** -- not a minor deficiency but a substantial failure to perform

### Surety's Options After Valid Claim

When the surety receives a valid performance bond claim, the surety has several options:

| Surety Option | What Happens | Typical Timeline | Pros for Obligee | Cons for Obligee |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Complete the work** | Surety hires a completion contractor | 30-90 days to mobilize | Surety manages completion risk | Surety controls contractor selection; may be slower |
| **Tender a new contractor** | Surety proposes a replacement contractor for obligee's approval | 30-60 days | Surety absorbs cost overrun | Obligee must accept surety's choice (with approval right) |
| **Pay the bond amount** | Surety pays obligee the cost to complete (up to bond limit) | 60-120 days | Obligee selects own contractor | Surety may dispute amount; may not cover full cost if over bond limit |
| **Finance the principal** | Surety provides funds to help defaulted contractor finish | Variable | Fastest mobilization (existing contractor) | Risk of repeated default; surety oversight required |
| **Deny the claim** | Surety determines default was not valid | 30-90 days investigation | N/A | Obligee must litigate or re-evaluate |

### Performance Bond Claim Documentation Checklist

Before filing a performance bond claim, assemble the following:

- [ ] Copy of the prime contract (or subcontract)
- [ ] Copy of the performance bond
- [ ] Copies of all cure notices with delivery confirmations
- [ ] Copy of the termination notice with delivery confirmation
- [ ] Chronological log of deficiencies with dates and descriptions
- [ ] Daily reports documenting performance failures
- [ ] Photos of deficient work, understaffing, abandoned work areas
- [ ] Meeting minutes documenting performance discussions
- [ ] Correspondence (emails, letters) regarding performance issues
- [ ] Schedule analysis showing critical path impact
- [ ] Cost estimate for completion by replacement contractor
- [ ] List of work completed and work remaining
- [ ] Current pay application status (amounts paid, amounts withheld, retainage held)

## Payment Bond -- Detailed Coverage and Claims

### Who Can Claim Against a Payment Bond

| Claimant Type | Federal (Miller Act) | State (Little Miller Acts) | Private Projects |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| **First-tier subcontractor** | Direct claim, no notice required | Varies -- some require preliminary notice | Per bond terms |
| **Second-tier sub (sub-sub)** | Must give 90-day written notice to contractor | Varies by state (30-90 days notice) | Per bond terms -- may be excluded |
| **Material supplier to GC** | Direct claim, no notice required | Varies by state | Per bond terms |
| **Material supplier to sub** | Must give 90-day written notice to contractor | Varies by state | Per bond terms -- may be excluded |
| **Laborers** | Direct claim, no notice required | Varies by state | Per bond terms |
| **Equipment rental** | Must give 90-day written notice (if not contracting directly with principal) | Varies by state | Per bond terms |
| **Third-tier and beyond** | Generally excluded | Varies -- most states limit to second tier | Generally excluded |

### Payment Bond Claim Timeline (Federal Miller Act)

```
Claimant last furnishes labor/materials to the project
    |
    v
Day 0: Start of claim period
    |
    v
Day 90: Deadline for second-tier claimants to send written notice to contractor
         (First-tier claimants do not need preliminary notice)
    |
    v
Day 90 (from notice, if required): Allow time for response/payment
    |
    v
1 Year from last furnishing: DEADLINE to file suit on the payment bond
                              (Missing this deadline extinguishes the claim)
```

### Red Flags Indicating Payment Bond Exposure

When you observe these on your project, alert your PM and accounting immediately:

| Red Flag | Severity | What to Do |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Sub's supplier delivers COD when they used to deliver on account | Medium | Investigate. Ask the sub directly. Check payment records. |
| Sub's workers approach GC staff about non-payment | High | Document the conversation. Notify PM. Verify sub's payment compliance. |
| Preliminary lien notices from unknown parties | High | Log every notice. Forward to PM and accounting. Compare against known sub-tier list. |
| Equipment being repossessed from site | Critical | Document with photos. Notify PM immediately. This indicates severe financial distress. |
| Sub requests advance payment or earlier payment schedule | Medium | Not unusual alone, but combined with other flags, indicates cash flow problems. |
| Sub's insurance lapses or is cancelled | High | Sub cannot work without insurance. May indicate inability to pay premiums. |
| Certified payroll complaints from sub's workers (prevailing wage projects) | High | Potential violation of Davis-Bacon or state prevailing wage law. Investigate immediately. |

## Insurance Types Comparison

### Commercial General Liability (CGL) -- Standard Coverage

| Coverage Part | What It Covers | What It Does Not Cover |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Coverage A: Bodily Injury & Property Damage** | Third-party injuries and property damage caused by operations | Contractor's own workers (that is WC), contractor's own property, intended acts |
| **Coverage B: Personal & Advertising Injury** | Libel, slander, invasion of privacy, false arrest | Usually not relevant to field operations |
| **Coverage C: Medical Payments** | Small medical claims without fault determination | Only for non-employees; capped at $5K-$10K |
| **Products/Completed Operations** | Claims arising from completed work | Only triggers after work is complete and accepted |

### CGL -- Limits Structure

| Limit Type | Typical Minimum | What It Means |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Each Occurrence | $1,000,000 | Maximum payout per incident |
| General Aggregate | $2,000,000 | Maximum total payout per policy year for all claims combined |
| Products/Completed Operations Aggregate | $2,000,000 | Separate aggregate for completed operations claims |
| Per Project Aggregate | Required by many GCs | Ensures the full aggregate is available for YOUR project, not shared with sub's other projects |

**What the super verifies:** Look for "Per Project Aggregate" endorsement on the COI. Without it, the sub's aggregate limit is shared across all their projects. If they have a big claim on another job, there may be nothing left for yours.

### Builder's Risk Insurance -- Project Property Coverage

| Feature | All-Risk Form (Preferred) | Named Perils Form (Less Coverage) |
|---------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **What is covered** | Everything except specific exclusions | Only perils specifically listed |
| **Common covered perils** | Fire, wind, hail, theft, vandalism, water damage, collapse, vehicle impact | Same -- but ONLY these listed perils |
| **Key exclusions** | Faulty workmanship (the work itself), earthquake, flood, war, nuclear | Same exclusions plus anything not listed |
| **Resulting damage** | Typically covered -- e.g., faulty wiring causes fire, fire damage is covered | May or may not cover resulting damage |
| **Theft** | Covered (with conditions -- materials must be secured) | May not cover unsecured materials |
| **Testing/Commissioning** | Usually excluded unless endorsed | Excluded |
| **Soft costs** | Excluded unless endorsed (design fees, financing, lease obligations) | Excluded |

### Builder's Risk -- Key Questions for the Super

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| Who purchased the policy -- owner or contractor? | Determines who files claims and who manages the deductible |
| What is the deductible? | Could be $5K or $100K -- know before an incident |
| Who pays the deductible per contract? | May be owner, contractor, or shared |
| Is flood coverage included? | Standard builder's risk excludes flood; requires separate endorsement or NFIP policy |
| Is earthquake coverage included? | Standard exclusion; requires endorsement in seismic zones |
| Are stored materials covered off-site? | Often requires specific endorsement for materials at fabrication shops, laydown yards |
| Is there a vacancy clause? | Some policies void coverage if site is unoccupied for 60+ consecutive days |
| What is the reporting requirement? | Typically 24-72 hours after discovery of loss |

### Workers Compensation -- What the Super Checks

| Verification Item | What to Check | Red Flag |
|-------------------|--------------|----------|
| **Policy in force** | Effective date through current, no lapses | Policy expired or "pending renewal" -- sub cannot work |
| **State coverage** | Policy covers the state where work is performed | Out-of-state sub with policy only covering their home state |
| **EMR (Experience Mod Rate)** | Below contract threshold (typically < 1.0 or < 1.2) | EMR above 1.5 = terrible safety record; above 2.0 = likely uninsurable |
| **Classification codes** | Correct NCCI codes for work being performed | Electrical sub classified as "office clerical" = misclassification fraud |
| **Employer name** | Matches subcontract entity name exactly | Different entity name may mean no coverage for workers on your site |
| **Monopolistic state fund** | Ohio, North Dakota, Washington, Wyoming use state-fund only | Sub must have state-fund certificate, not private WC policy |

### Workers Comp EMR Interpretation Guide

| EMR Range | Safety Record | Field Decision |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| 0.60 - 0.80 | Excellent -- well below industry average | Preferred sub. Low risk. |
| 0.80 - 1.00 | Good to average | Acceptable. Standard oversight. |
| 1.00 - 1.20 | Average to slightly above | Acceptable on most projects. Increase safety monitoring. |
| 1.20 - 1.50 | Above average losses | May not meet contract requirements. Requires PM approval. Heightened safety oversight. |
| 1.50 - 2.00 | Poor safety record | Likely does not meet contract requirements. Do not allow on site without corporate approval. |
| Above 2.00 | Severe -- may be in assigned risk pool | Do not allow on site. Sub may be unable to obtain coverage. |

### Professional Liability (Errors & Omissions)

**When required in construction:**

| Scenario | Who Carries It | Typical Limit |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Design-build project (GC has design responsibility) | GC or design-build entity | $1M - $5M per claim |
| Sub with design responsibility (MEP design-build) | Sub (e.g., mechanical contractor designing HVAC system) | $1M - $2M per claim |
| Delegated design elements | Sub performing delegated design (connection design, curtain wall engineering) | $500K - $2M per claim |
| Construction manager as agent | CM firm | $1M - $5M per claim |
| Testing and inspection firms | Testing lab (geotech, special inspections) | $500K - $2M per claim |

**Key difference from CGL:** Professional liability covers DESIGN errors. CGL covers CONSTRUCTION operations. A CGL policy will NOT cover a claim arising from a defective design by the contractor.

## OCIP vs CCIP Decision Matrix

### When Each Type Is Used

| Factor | Favors OCIP | Favors CCIP |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Project size** | Very large ($100M+) -- owner can negotiate bulk rates | Large ($50M+) -- GC has strong insurance program |
| **Owner sophistication** | Experienced owner with insurance expertise | Less experienced owner, experienced GC |
| **Owner's risk tolerance** | Owner wants control over insurance program | Owner prefers GC to manage insurance |
| **Cost savings potential** | Higher -- owner eliminates contractor markup on insurance | Moderate -- GC passes savings through bid deductions |
| **Claims management** | Owner manages claims directly (or through broker) | GC manages claims -- may be faster for field issues |
| **Safety program** | Owner sets and enforces safety standards | GC sets and enforces safety standards (typical) |
| **Administrative burden** | On owner (enrollment, compliance, premium audit) | On GC (enrollment, compliance, premium audit) |

### Wrap-Up Enrollment Requirements

When your project has an OCIP or CCIP, every sub must be enrolled BEFORE starting work on site.

**Enrollment checklist for subs:**

- [ ] Sub completes enrollment application (payroll data, classification codes, loss history)
- [ ] Sub provides current insurance certificates (their own policies remain for off-site operations)
- [ ] Sub acknowledges wrap-up safety requirements
- [ ] Sub's bid deduction for insurance verified (typically 2-5% of labor cost)
- [ ] Sub receives enrollment confirmation from wrap-up administrator
- [ ] Sub's on-site operations are now covered under the wrap-up

**Common wrap-up exclusions (parties NOT covered):**
- Material suppliers who only deliver (no on-site installation)
- Truckers and haulers
- Off-site fabricators
- Professional consultants (surveyors, testing labs)
- Equipment rental companies (operators covered, owned equipment not covered)
- Watchmen and security services

**What the super enforces:**
1. No sub starts work without enrollment confirmation
2. All incidents reported to the wrap-up administrator (not just the GC's insurer)
3. Wrap-up safety manual requirements followed on site
4. Sub payroll reported monthly or per wrap-up audit requirements
5. Unenrolled parties carry their own insurance and provide COIs

## COI Verification Checklist -- Step-by-Step

Use this checklist every time a new sub mobilizes to your site. Do not let a sub start work until every item is verified.

### Step 1: Receive and Log the COI

- [ ] COI received from sub (not generated by you)
- [ ] Date stamped and logged in insurance tracking system
- [ ] Copy filed in project records

### Step 2: Verify Entity Name

- [ ] Named insured on COI matches the exact legal entity name on the subcontract
- [ ] If different (even slightly), clarify with sub -- "ABC Plumbing LLC" vs "ABC Plumbing Inc." are different legal entities
- [ ] Verify the COI is not for a parent company, sister company, or other related entity

### Step 3: Verify Coverage Types and Limits

- [ ] **General Liability**: Each Occurrence >= contract requirement (typically $1M)
- [ ] **General Liability**: General Aggregate >= contract requirement (typically $2M)
- [ ] **General Liability**: Products/Completed Operations >= contract requirement (typically $2M)
- [ ] **Workers Compensation**: Statutory limits for the state of the project
- [ ] **Workers Compensation**: Employer's Liability >= contract requirement (typically $500K/$500K/$500K)
- [ ] **Automobile Liability**: Combined Single Limit >= contract requirement (typically $1M)
- [ ] **Umbrella/Excess**: If required by contract (typically $1M-$5M over primary CGL/Auto/WC)
- [ ] **Professional Liability**: If sub has any design responsibility

### Step 4: Verify Endorsements

- [ ] **Additional Insured**: Owner AND GC listed as additional insured (not just "certificate holder")
- [ ] **Waiver of Subrogation**: Endorsement in favor of owner and GC
- [ ] **Per Project Aggregate**: If required by contract
- [ ] **Primary and Non-Contributory**: Sub's policy is primary (GC's policy does not share the loss)
- [ ] **30-Day Cancellation Notice**: Insurer will notify certificate holder 30 days before cancellation

### Step 5: Verify Workers Comp Specifics

- [ ] EMR at or below contract threshold
- [ ] Classification codes appropriate for the work being performed
- [ ] State of coverage matches project state
- [ ] No "if any" exclusions for the type of work

### Step 6: Check for Exclusions

- [ ] No exclusion for the type of work being performed (some policies exclude: hot work, demolition, blasting, environmental, roofing, underground work)
- [ ] No exclusion for the project type (residential vs commercial)
- [ ] No "cross-suits" exclusion that would prevent additional insured coverage
- [ ] No "sunset" clause that limits completed operations coverage

### Step 7: Document and Track

- [ ] Enter expiration dates in insurance tracking system
- [ ] Set 60-day renewal reminders for all policies
- [ ] Note any deficiencies and timeline for correction
- [ ] Notify sub in writing of any deficiencies
- [ ] Sub cannot work until all deficiencies are corrected

## Common Insurance Gaps That Create Field Risk

### Gap 1: Additional Insured Endorsement Missing or Deficient

**The problem:** The COI says "Additional Insured" in the description box, but no actual endorsement exists on the policy. A COI is a snapshot -- it can be wrong or misleading.

**The fix:** Request a copy of the actual Additional Insured endorsement (CG 20 10 or equivalent) from the sub's broker. Do not rely solely on the COI.

### Gap 2: Policy Aggregate Exhausted

**The problem:** Sub had a major claim on another project. Their $2M aggregate is already depleted. Your project has no coverage left.

**The fix:** Require Per Project Aggregate endorsement. This gives your project its own full aggregate, regardless of claims on the sub's other jobs.

### Gap 3: Workers Comp Classification Mismatch

**The problem:** An electrical sub's WC policy classifies their workers as "office clerical" instead of "electrical wiring." If a worker is injured, the insurer may deny the claim due to misclassification.

**The fix:** Verify NCCI classification codes on the WC policy match the work being performed. Common construction codes: 5190 (electrical), 5183 (plumbing/HVAC), 5403 (carpentry), 5022 (masonry), 5213 (concrete).

### Gap 4: Auto Liability Excluding Hired/Non-Owned Vehicles

**The problem:** Sub's auto policy only covers owned vehicles. Sub's foreman drives a rental car to the site and causes an accident. No coverage.

**The fix:** Verify auto policy includes "Hired and Non-Owned Auto" coverage.

### Gap 5: No Completed Operations Coverage

**The problem:** After the sub finishes their work and leaves, a defect in their work causes property damage or injury. Their CGL "occurrence" coverage may not respond if the policy was cancelled or expired.

**The fix:** Verify Products/Completed Operations coverage with adequate limits and ensure it does not expire at project completion.

### Gap 6: Subrogation Waiver Missing

**The problem:** Sub's insurer pays a claim, then sues the GC to recover the payment (subrogation). The GC's insurance has to respond, increasing the GC's loss history and premiums.

**The fix:** Require Waiver of Subrogation endorsement on all sub policies. This prevents the sub's insurer from suing the GC for covered losses.

### Gap 7: Builder's Risk Not Covering Sub's Installed Work

**The problem:** A fire damages a floor of the building. The builder's risk policy covers the structure, but the sub's installed work (mechanical ductwork, electrical conduit) may not be covered if the policy does not include sub's work.

**The fix:** Verify builder's risk policy covers "all insurable values of the Work" including sub's installed work and materials stored on site. Standard AIA A201 requires this.

## Insurance Claim Procedures for Field Personnel

### When to Report

| Event Type | Report To | Deadline | What to Include |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Worker injury (any severity)** | WC carrier + safety director | Same day | Incident report, witness statements, medical info |
| **Third-party injury on site** | CGL carrier + risk manager | Same day | Incident report, site conditions, photos, witnesses |
| **Property damage to project** | Builder's risk carrier + PM | Within 24 hours | Photos, description of damage, estimated cost, cause |
| **Vehicle accident** | Auto carrier + fleet manager | Same day | Police report, photos, driver info, witness info |
| **Theft or vandalism** | Builder's risk carrier + police | Within 24 hours | Police report, photos, inventory of missing/damaged items |
| **Environmental release** | Pollution carrier (if any) + environmental consultant | Immediately | Contain the release, photos, material info, authorities notified |

### Field Superintendent's Reporting Duties

1. **Secure the scene** -- Prevent further injury or damage
2. **Render aid** -- Call 911 if needed; provide first aid
3. **Document** -- Photos, witness names, conditions, time, weather
4. **Notify** -- Call your safety director, PM, and corporate risk manager
5. **Preserve evidence** -- Do not clean up, repair, or discard damaged materials until cleared by the insurer/adjuster
6. **Complete incident report** -- Within 24 hours, thorough and factual
7. **Cooperate with investigation** -- Adjuster, safety team, OSHA (if applicable)
8. **Do not admit fault** -- Gather facts, do not assign blame. That is for the investigation.
