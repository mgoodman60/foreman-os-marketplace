# Dispute Resolution Field Guide

## Overview

Every construction project has disagreements. Most get resolved at the field level through conversation and common sense. But when they do not, the contract provides a structured resolution path. The superintendent's role is to preserve the project's rights through proper documentation and timely notice, then support the resolution process with organized records and factual testimony.

This guide covers the entire dispute resolution path from the moment a field issue becomes a potential claim through formal resolution. The emphasis is on what the superintendent does at each stage -- the actions, documentation, and deadlines that determine outcomes.

**The golden rule of construction disputes: Written notice, on time, every time.** Nothing else matters as much.

### When to Send Notice -- Decision Tree

```
Something happened on the project that:
  - Costs money that is not in the contract, OR
  - Delays the schedule, OR
  - Changes the scope, OR
  - Creates a new condition not contemplated by the contract
    |
    v
Has 10 days passed since the event? -----> No --> You have time. Start
    |                                               drafting the notice NOW.
    v                                               Do not wait.
Yes
    |
    v
Has 15 days passed? -----> No --> Send the notice THIS WEEK.
    |                              Do not let the deadline approach.
    v
Yes
    |
    v
Has 20 days passed (AIA)? -----> No --> Send the notice TODAY.
    |                                     Drop everything else.
    v
Yes -- and AIA 21-day deadline is tomorrow or passed
    |
    v
EMERGENCY: Send whatever you have RIGHT NOW.
  - Even a one-paragraph email preserves the notice
  - Follow up with a formal letter
  - "Better imperfect and on time than perfect and late"
  - If the deadline has passed, send notice anyway and argue
    the discovery date or continuing nature of the event
```

**CRITICAL FIELD RULE:** When in doubt, send the notice. Sending a notice costs nothing. Missing a notice deadline can cost the project hundreds of thousands of dollars. You can always withdraw a claim later. You cannot file a claim after the deadline has passed.

## Cure Notice Procedures -- Step-by-Step

### When a Cure Notice Is Required

A cure notice is required before terminating a subcontractor for cause. It is the formal, final warning that gives the sub a contractual opportunity to fix the problem before termination.

### AIA A401 Cure Notice Procedure

| Step | Action | Timeline | Documentation |
|------|--------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Identify the specific default(s) | Ongoing -- documented in daily reports | Daily reports, photos, emails, inspection records |
| 2 | Verbal warning to sub | Day 0 | Daily report entry noting conversation |
| 3 | Written warning letter | Day 3-7 | Formal letter to sub PM and corporate office |
| 4 | Evaluate sub's response to written warning | Day 7-14 | Document any improvement or continued deficiency |
| 5 | Draft cure notice | Day 14-18 | Use template below; review with PM and counsel |
| 6 | Send cure notice | Day 18-21 | Certified mail AND email to registered address |
| 7 | Monitor cure period | Day 21-28 | Daily documentation of sub's cure efforts (or lack thereof) |
| 8 | Evaluate cure | Day 28 | Determine if cure is "satisfactory" |
| 9a | Cure satisfactory | -- | Document cure, continue monitoring, close the notice |
| 9b | Cure unsatisfactory | Day 28-30 | Proceed to termination notice |

      Project: [Project Name]
      Project No.: [Project Number]
      Subcontract: [Subcontract No.] dated [Date]
      Subcontract Scope: [Brief scope description]

Dear [Name]:

Pursuant to Article 12 of AIA A401-2017 [or applicable subcontract provision],
[GC Name] hereby provides formal notice of [Sub Name]'s failure to perform in
accordance with the Subcontract. [Sub Name] is directed to cure the following

  - Prior notice: [Reference to prior written warning, date]

[Continue for all deficiencies]

REQUIRED CURE ACTIONS:
1. [Specific, measurable action sub must take -- e.g., "Provide minimum 12
   journeyman electricians on site daily by [date]"]
2. [Specific action -- e.g., "Complete correction of deficient drywall

### Evaluating Whether Cure Is "Satisfactory"

The contract says the sub must achieve "satisfactory" cure. Here is how to evaluate:

| Criterion | Satisfactory | Unsatisfactory |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Timeliness** | Cure efforts began within 7 days | No action taken, or action started after deadline |
| **Effort** | Demonstrable increase in resources, activity, and progress | Token effort -- one extra worker for one day |
| **Quality** | Corrected work meets contract requirements | Corrected work still has deficiencies |
| **Continuity** | Cure efforts are sustained, not a one-day spike | Effort drops off after initial cure activity |
| **Communication** | Sub provides written recovery plan and status updates | Sub does not communicate or makes vague promises |
| **Schedule recovery** | Realistic recovery schedule submitted and being followed | No recovery schedule, or schedule is unrealistic |
| **Root cause** | Sub addresses underlying problem (staffing, management, equipment) | Sub addresses symptoms only; underlying problem remains |

**Document your evaluation in writing.** Whether you find the cure satisfactory or unsatisfactory, put it in a letter to the sub with specific observations supporting your conclusion.

## Mediation Preparation Checklist

Mediation is the first formal dispute resolution step under most AIA contracts. It is non-binding -- the mediator facilitates settlement but does not impose a decision. Approximately 70-80% of construction mediations result in settlement.

### Pre-Mediation Preparation (Superintendent's Role)

**Documentation Assembly (2-4 weeks before mediation):**

- [ ] Chronological timeline of events related to the dispute
- [ ] All daily reports covering the disputed period
- [ ] All photographs relevant to the dispute (organized by date and subject)
- [ ] All correspondence (emails, letters) between the parties regarding the disputed issue
- [ ] All meeting minutes where the disputed issue was discussed
- [ ] All RFIs related to the dispute
- [ ] All change orders and CCDs related to the dispute
- [ ] All notices sent and received (with delivery confirmations)
- [ ] Schedule analysis showing delay impacts (if time is disputed)
- [ ] Cost documentation (labor records, material invoices, equipment tickets) if cost is disputed
- [ ] Sub pay applications and lien waivers (if payment is at issue)
- [ ] Expert reports (if any -- schedule expert, cost expert, design expert)

**Narrative Summary (1-2 weeks before mediation):**

- [ ] Write a clear, factual summary of events from the field perspective
- [ ] Organize by chronology, not by argument
- [ ] Stick to facts -- what happened, when, where, who was involved
- [ ] Reference supporting documents by date and description
- [ ] Avoid opinions, conclusions, or legal arguments (leave those to counsel)
- [ ] Have your PM and counsel review the summary

**Personal Preparation (1 week before mediation):**

- [ ] Review all documents thoroughly -- you may be asked about any detail
- [ ] Be prepared to answer questions about daily operations, conditions, and decisions
- [ ] Practice explaining complex construction issues in plain language
- [ ] Understand the other side's likely arguments
- [ ] Know your weaknesses -- the mediator and the other side will find them
- [ ] Be prepared to be flexible -- mediation is about settlement, not winning

### During Mediation -- Superintendent's Guidelines

1. **Be truthful** -- Credibility is your single most important asset. If you do not remember something, say so. If a fact is unfavorable, acknowledge it. The other side will exploit any inconsistency.

2. **Be specific** -- "We had problems" is not helpful. "On March 15, the drywall crew had 4 workers instead of the 12 required by their submitted schedule" is useful.

3. **Reference documents** -- "As shown in the daily report for April 3..." is much more persuasive than unsupported assertions.

4. **Stay calm** -- Mediation can be adversarial in caucus sessions. Do not get defensive or angry. If the other side makes false claims, calmly respond with facts and documentation.

5. **Let counsel lead** -- Your role is to provide factual testimony and construction expertise. Your attorney handles the legal strategy and negotiation.

6. **Be patient** -- Mediations often take all day (8-12 hours). Settlement typically comes in the last few hours after both sides are exhausted.

## Arbitration Process Overview

If mediation fails, and the contract selects arbitration, the dispute proceeds to binding arbitration under the AAA Construction Industry Arbitration Rules (or other rules as specified in the contract).

### Arbitration Timeline and Process

| Phase | Duration | What Happens | Super's Role |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Demand** | Day 0 | Claimant files demand for arbitration with AAA | Provide documentation for the demand |
| **Respondent's Answer** | 14 days | Respondent files answer and any counterclaims | Provide documentation for answer/counterclaims |
| **Arbitrator Selection** | 30-45 days | AAA provides list of arbitrators; parties rank preferences | Review arbitrator construction backgrounds with counsel |
| **Preliminary Hearing** | 60-90 days | Arbitrator sets schedule, rules on discovery scope, identifies issues | Attend if requested; help counsel understand technical issues |
| **Discovery** | 90-180 days | Document exchange, depositions (limited), interrogatories | Produce project files; prepare for deposition; help review opponent's documents |
| **Pre-Hearing Briefs** | 180-270 days | Parties submit written arguments and exhibits | Review briefs for factual accuracy |
| **Hearing** | 240-360 days | Live testimony, cross-examination, exhibits presented | Testify as fact witness; attend daily; assist counsel |
| **Post-Hearing Briefs** | 30 days after hearing | Final written arguments | Review for factual accuracy |
| **Award** | 30-60 days after briefs | Arbitrator issues binding award | N/A |

### Key Differences Between Arbitration and Litigation

| Feature | Arbitration | Litigation |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **Decision maker** | Arbitrator(s) -- often retired judges or experienced construction attorneys | Judge and/or jury |
| **Rules of evidence** | Relaxed -- hearsay may be admitted | Formal -- strict rules of evidence |
| **Discovery** | Limited -- fewer depositions, narrower document requests | Extensive -- broad discovery rights |
| **Duration** | 6-18 months typically | 1-3+ years typically |
| **Cost** | Arbitrator fees ($500-$1,500+/day) + AAA admin fees + attorney fees | Court filing fees + attorney fees (often higher total due to longer duration) |
| **Appeal rights** | Very limited -- can only challenge on narrow grounds (fraud, bias, exceeding authority) | Full appellate rights |
| **Confidentiality** | Private proceedings -- not public record | Public record (unless sealed by court order) |
| **Consolidation** | Difficult to join multiple parties | Easier to join related parties and claims |
| **Jury** | No jury | Jury available in most cases |
| **Location** | Per agreement or AAA determination | Court in jurisdiction specified by contract or where project is located |

### Superintendent's Deposition/Testimony Preparation

If you are deposed or testify at a hearing:

**Before testimony:**
1. Review all daily reports for the relevant period
2. Review all correspondence and emails you sent or received
3. Review all meeting minutes you attended
4. Review any statements you previously made about the dispute
5. Meet with your attorney to prepare -- this is NOT improper; it is expected
6. Identify any documents you may be asked about

**During testimony:**
1. **Listen to the full question** before answering
2. **Answer only what was asked** -- do not volunteer extra information
3. **"I don't recall"** is a perfectly acceptable answer if true
4. **Ask for clarification** if a question is confusing or ambiguous
5. **Do not guess** -- if you do not know, say so
6. **Refer to documents** -- "According to my daily report for that date..." is stronger than memory alone
7. **Do not argue** with the opposing attorney -- answer factually and move on
8. **Take breaks** if you need to -- ask your attorney
9. **Be consistent** -- if your testimony contradicts your daily reports, you have a credibility problem

## Documentation Requirements for Each Resolution Pathway

### Documentation Matrix

| Document Type | Direct Negotiation | IDM Decision | Mediation | Arbitration | Litigation |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Daily reports** | Helpful | Required | Required | Required | Required |
| **Photos/video** | Helpful | Helpful | Required | Required | Required |
| **Correspondence (emails/letters)** | Helpful | Required | Required | Required | Required |
| **Meeting minutes** | Helpful | Helpful | Required | Required | Required |
| **Contractual notices** | Required | Required | Required | Required | Required |
| **Schedule analysis** | Helpful (if time dispute) | Required (if time dispute) | Required (if time dispute) | Required | Required |
| **Cost backup (labor, materials, equipment)** | Required (if cost dispute) | Required (if cost dispute) | Required | Required | Required |
| **Expert reports** | Rarely needed | Sometimes | Sometimes | Often | Often |
| **Witness statements** | Rarely needed | Sometimes | Rarely | Required | Required |
| **Sub pay apps/invoices** | If payment dispute | If payment dispute | If payment dispute | Required | Required |
| **Inspection records** | If quality dispute | If quality dispute | Required | Required | Required |
| **RFIs and submittals** | If design dispute | If design dispute | Required | Required | Required |

### Documentation Quality Standards

For documents to be useful in dispute resolution, they must meet these standards:

| Standard | What It Means | Common Failures |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Contemporaneous** | Created at or near the time of the event | Written weeks or months later from memory |
| **Specific** | Includes dates, names, locations, quantities, conditions | Vague generalizations ("we had problems") |
| **Factual** | States what happened, not opinions or conclusions | "The sub was negligent" instead of "The sub had 3 workers instead of the 12 required per their schedule" |
| **Consistent** | Matches other records for the same date/event | Daily report says one thing, email says another |
| **Complete** | Covers the full scope of relevant events | Gaps in the record during critical periods |
| **Organized** | Filed chronologically and by subject | Random collection of unsorted documents |
| **Authenticated** | Author identifiable, date verifiable | Unsigned, undated documents |

    |
    v No: Proceed to Phase 2
```

### Phase 2: Formal Notice and IDM (Days 14-60)

```
Prepare written Notice of Claim (per contract requirements)
    |
    v
CRITICAL: Is the notice deadline approaching?
    |
    +---> AIA: 21 days from occurrence
    +---> ConsensusDocs: 14 days from occurrence
    +---> EJCDC: 30 days from occurrence
    |
    v
Send notice via certified mail AND email to:

  - Keep delivery confirmations
    |
    v
IDM receives claim and reviews (AIA A201 Section 15.2)
    |
    v
IDM may request additional information
  - Provide promptly and completely
  - Document what was provided and when
    |
    v
IDM renders initial decision (within 10 days of adequate info)
    |
    +---> IDM decides in claimant's favor?
    |         |
    |         v Yes: Other party accepts? --> Implement, proceed
    |                Other party objects? --> Proceed to Phase 3
    |
    +---> IDM decides against claimant?
    |         |
    |         v Claimant accepts? --> Close the claim, proceed
    |               Claimant objects? --> Proceed to Phase 3
    |
    +---> IDM fails to decide within 30 days?
              |
              v Claim automatically proceeds to Phase 3
```

### Phase 3: Mediation (Days 60-120)

```
Party requests mediation per contract (AIA A201 Section 15.3)
    |
    v
Parties select mediator (from AAA panel or by agreement)
    |
    v
Schedule mediation (typically 30-60 days out)
    |
    v
Pre-mediation preparation:
  - Assemble documentation package

    |                Implement terms, close the dispute
    |
    v No: Impasse declared --> Proceed to Phase 4
```

### Phase 4: Arbitration or Litigation (Day 120+)

```
Check contract: Does it specify arbitration or litigation?
    |
    +---> Arbitration (AIA A201 Section 15.4):
    |         |
    |         v File Demand for Arbitration with AAA
    |           See Arbitration Process Overview above
    |           Binding and final decision (very limited appeal)
    |
    +---> Litigation (no arbitration clause):
    |         |
    |         v File complaint in appropriate court
    |           Full discovery, formal trial, appellate rights
    |           Longer timeline but more procedural protections
    |
    +---> Contract is silent on dispute resolution:
              |
              v Litigation is the default
                Check statute of limitations for your claim type
                (Varies by state: 3-10 years for breach of contract)
```

## Dispute Prevention -- Proactive Measures

The best dispute resolution is dispute prevention. These practices reduce the likelihood that field issues escalate to formal claims.

### Daily Practices

| Practice | How It Prevents Disputes |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Complete, accurate daily reports** | Creates contemporaneous record that resolves "he said/she said" |
| **Photo documentation** | Visual evidence eliminates arguments about site conditions |
| **Written confirmations of verbal conversations** | Prevents misunderstandings about what was agreed |
| **Timely RFI submission** | Resolves design questions before they become field problems |
| **Schedule updates** | Early identification of delays before they become critical |
| **Pay app accuracy** | Prevents overbilling disputes and trust breakdowns |
| **Sub coordination meetings** | Resolves conflicts between trades before they impact work |

### Weekly Practices

| Practice | How It Prevents Disputes |
|----------|------------------------|
| **OAC meeting with documented minutes** | Regular communication prevents surprise claims |
| **Schedule review** | Identifies potential delays early |
| **Pay app status review** | Catches payment issues before they escalate |
| **Insurance/compliance tracking** | Prevents coverage gaps that create liability |
| **Sub performance review** | Early intervention prevents defaults |

### Monthly Practices

| Practice | How It Prevents Disputes |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Contract compliance audit** | Verify all notice requirements are current |
| **Lien waiver reconciliation** | Identify gaps before they block funding |
| **Change order status review** | Resolve pending COs before they age into claims |
| **Delay log review** | Ensure all potential delay claims are noticed |
| **Cost-to-complete update** | Early warning of budget issues |

---

## Dispute Resolution Cost Estimates

Understanding the cost of dispute resolution helps frame settlement decisions. Often, settling for less than the full claim is more economical than proceeding through arbitration or litigation.

| Resolution Method | Estimated Cost Range | Duration | When to Use |
|------------------|---------------------|----------|-------------|
| **Direct negotiation** | $0 - $5,000 (internal time only) | Days to weeks | First attempt for all disputes |
| **IDM decision** | $0 - $10,000 (internal time + documentation) | 10-30 days | Required under AIA before mediation |
| **Mediation** | $5,000 - $25,000 (mediator fees + attorney + preparation) | 1 day session + 30-60 days preparation | Required under most AIA contracts; high success rate |
| **Arbitration** | $50,000 - $500,000+ (arbitrator + AAA + attorney + experts) | 6-18 months | When mediation fails; binding result |
| **Litigation** | $100,000 - $1,000,000+ (attorney + experts + court costs) | 1-3+ years | When no arbitration clause; or complex multi-party disputes |

**Rule of thumb for settlement decisions:** If the cost to litigate exceeds 30-50% of the disputed amount, settlement is usually the economically rational choice -- even if you believe you are 100% right. Factor in the uncertainty of any adjudicated outcome and the distraction of management time.

## Special Dispute Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Constructive Change Claim

**What it is:** Work was changed without a formal Change Order. This happens when: the architect issues a field directive, the owner verbally instructs different work, drawings are revised without a CO, or the interpretation of a specification requires more expensive work than anticipated.

**What to do:**
1. Identify the change in real time (during execution)
2. Document the directive or condition that constitutes the change
3. Send written notice within the contractual deadline (21 days AIA)
4. Continue performing the work (do not stop)
5. Track costs separately (T&M if possible)
6. Submit a formal Change Order Request with cost and schedule impact

### Scenario 2: Differing Site Conditions

**What it is:** The actual site conditions differ materially from what was represented in the contract documents (Type I) or from what a reasonable contractor would expect (Type II).

**What to do:**
1. Stop work in the affected area (do not disturb the conditions)
2. Notify the architect and owner immediately in writing
3. Photograph and document the conditions before any disturbance
4. Request the architect's direction on how to proceed
5. File a formal claim notice within the contractual deadline
6. Track additional costs from the differing conditions

### Scenario 3: Delay by Separate Contractor

**What it is:** Another contractor (not your sub) hired directly by the owner is causing delays to your work.

**What to do:**
1. Document the delay in your daily report (who, what, when, impact)
2. Notify the owner in writing -- the owner is responsible for coordinating separate contractors (AIA A201 Section 6.1)
3. File a delay claim notice within 21 days
