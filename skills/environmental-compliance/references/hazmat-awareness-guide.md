## 1. Asbestos Identification and Field Awareness

### What Is Asbestos?

Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral fiber that was widely used in building materials from the 1920s through the 1980s for its fire resistance, insulation, and durability properties. When disturbed, asbestos fibers become airborne and can cause serious lung disease (asbestosis), mesothelioma, and lung cancer.

**Key Rule**: You **cannot identify asbestos by visual inspection alone**. Only laboratory analysis (PLM — Polarized Light Microscopy, or TEM — Transmission Electron Microscopy) can confirm asbestos presence. However, field awareness of common ACM (asbestos-containing materials) helps you avoid accidental disturbance.

### Common ACM Locations in Buildings

| Location | Material | Appearance | Era |
|----------|----------|------------|-----|
| Floor tiles | 9"x9" vinyl-asbestos tile (VAT) | Typically 9"x9" (modern tiles are 12"x12"); dark colors common | Pre-1980 |
| Floor tile adhesive | Black mastic ("cutback" adhesive) | Thick black tar-like adhesive under tiles | Pre-1980 |
| Pipe insulation | Corrugated paper or felt wrapping | Gray/white corrugated wrap on pipes; may have canvas jacket | Pre-1980 |
| Boiler/equipment insulation | Spray-applied or troweled insulation | White/gray chalky material on boilers, tanks, fittings | Pre-1980 |
| Popcorn/textured ceilings | Spray-applied ceiling texture | Bumpy "cottage cheese" texture; friable when dry | Pre-1980 |
| Transite panels/pipe | Cement-asbestos board or pipe | Gray cement board (looks like thin concrete); very hard | Pre-1980 |
| Roof felts and mastics | Asphalt-based roofing materials | Black felt paper, flashing cement | Pre-1985 |
| Fireproofing spray | Spray-applied fireproofing on steel | Gray/white fluffy spray on structural steel | Pre-1975 |
| Joint compound | Drywall tape mud and texture | Dried mud at drywall joints; powdery when sanded | Pre-1980 |
| Window glazing/caulk | Glazing compound around glass | Putty-like material in window frames | Pre-1985 |
| Insulation (vermiculite) | Loose-fill attic insulation | Small gold/brown pebble-like granules | Zonolite brand especially |
| Brake pads/clutch | Vehicle and equipment parts | — | Pre-1990 |

### Pre-Demolition Survey Requirements

**When Required**:
- Before ANY demolition of existing structures (NESHAP requirement)
- Before ANY renovation that will disturb more than threshold amounts of building material
- The building owner is responsible for commissioning the survey

**Survey Process**:
1. State-certified asbestos inspector conducts building inspection
2. Suspect materials sampled and sent to accredited lab
3. Survey report identifies all ACM and PACM (Presumed ACM)
4. Report includes location, condition, quantity, and friability assessment
5. Results provided to contractor before bid or before work begins

**What to Do If Survey Was NOT Completed**:
- **STOP** — Do not proceed with demolition or renovation
- Notify PM and owner immediately
- All suspect materials must be treated as PACM until surveyed
- EPA notification still required 10 working days before demolition
- Contractor has no obligation to proceed without survey results

### Asbestos Abatement Overview

**Superintendent's Role**: The superintendent does NOT perform abatement. Licensed abatement contractors handle removal. However, the superintendent must:

1. **Verify** licensed abatement contractor is on-site with proper credentials
2. **Coordinate** scheduling — abatement must be complete before general demolition/renovation
3. **Enforce** work area isolation (no unauthorized entry into abatement zones)
4. **Verify** air monitoring results meet clearance criteria before re-occupying area
5. **Document** abatement completion (clearance report, waste manifests, contractor certification)
6. **File** documentation with project records and LEED coordinator (if applicable)

**Abatement Sequence**:
```
Survey Complete → EPA Notification (10 days) → Area Isolation →
Negative Air Established → Wet Removal → Waste Packaging →
Air Monitoring → Clearance Testing → Area Released → Documentation Filed
```

**Clearance Criteria**:
- PCM (Phase Contrast Microscopy): < 0.01 fibers/cc (aggressive air sampling)
- Visual inspection: No visible debris or residue
- All waste manifested and shipped to licensed landfill

### Accidental Asbestos Disturbance Protocol

If you suspect asbestos has been accidentally disturbed:

```
STOP ALL WORK in affected area immediately
    │
    ├─ Evacuate non-essential personnel from area
    │
    ├─ Isolate area (tape, signage: "DANGER — ASBESTOS")
    │
    ├─ Do NOT attempt cleanup (will spread fibers)
    │
    ├─ Notify PM, safety manager, and owner immediately
    │
    ├─ Contact licensed abatement contractor for assessment
    │
    ├─ Document: photos, description of disturbance, materials involved
    │
    ├─ If significant fiber release: notify EPA within 24 hours
    │
    └─ Do NOT resume work until area assessed and cleared by qualified professional
```

## 2. Lead Paint Testing and RRP Procedures

### When Lead Testing Is Required

**Trigger**: ANY renovation, repair, or painting work in buildings constructed **before 1978**.

**Building Types Requiring Compliance**:
- Residential housing (single/multi-family)
- Child-occupied facilities (schools, daycares, children's clinics)
- NOT required for: commercial/industrial buildings (but recommended)

### Lead Testing Methods

| Method | Description | Speed | Accuracy | Cost |
|--------|-------------|-------|----------|------|
| XRF Analyzer | Portable X-ray device; non-destructive | Instant (field) | High (certified operator) | $300-500/day rental |
| Paint chip lab analysis | Samples sent to lab for atomic absorption | 3-5 days | Very High | $25-50/sample |
| EPA-recognized test kit | Chemical test swabs (LeadCheck, etc.) | Instant (field) | Moderate (false negatives possible) | $2-5/swab |

**Positive Results**:
- XRF: > 1.0 mg/cm2
- Lab analysis: > 0.5% by weight (5,000 ppm)
- Test kit: positive color change per manufacturer instructions

**If Positive**: Full RRP Rule procedures required for all work disturbing painted surfaces.

### RRP Rule Compliance Checklist

4. Abrasive blasting without HEPA vacuum attachment
5. Heat gun above 1100 degrees F
6. Dry scraping more than 2 square feet per room (interior) or per exterior component
7. Using chemical strippers containing methylene chloride

**Cleanup and Clearance**:
1. Collect all visible paint chips and debris
2. Mist work area to control dust
3. HEPA vacuum all surfaces (floors, window sills, window troughs)
4. Wet wipe all surfaces with disposable wipes
5. Visually inspect — no visible dust, chips, or residue
6. Clearance testing by certified inspector or risk assessor:
   - Floors: < 10 ug/SF
   - Interior window sills: < 100 ug/SF
   - Window troughs: < 400 ug/SF
7. Document clearance results
8. Dispose of all waste as lead-contaminated (characterize or assume lead waste)

### Lead Waste Disposal

- Test waste with TCLP (Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure) to determine if hazardous
- If TCLP lead > 5.0 mg/L: dispose as hazardous waste (RCRA D008)
- If TCLP lead < 5.0 mg/L: dispose as non-hazardous solid waste (check state requirements)
- Waste containers labeled: "Lead-Contaminated Debris"
- Manifest required if hazardous waste (EPA Form 8700-22)

## 3. Mold Prevention and Response

### Construction Mold Risk Factors

| Risk Factor | Why It Matters | Prevention |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Open building (pre-dry-in) | Rain exposure to framing, subfloor | Tarp coverage; expedite dry-in |
| Drywall before dry-in | Drywall absorbs moisture rapidly | Do not install drywall until building is weather-tight |
| Material storage (ground contact) | Wicking moisture from soil/concrete | Pallets, dunnage, 4" minimum off ground |
| HVAC before commissioning | Condensation in uncontrolled ductwork | Seal ducts; do not run HVAC without controls |
| Concrete cure moisture | High humidity in enclosed spaces | Ventilate during cure; dehumidify if needed |
| Plumbing leaks during rough-in | Water damage to framing, drywall | Pressure test and fix leaks BEFORE closing walls |
| Roof leaks | Water intrusion to insulation, ceilings | Fix immediately; do not install finishes over wet structure |

### Moisture Content Guidelines

| Material | Maximum Moisture Content Before Installation | Test Method |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Dimensional lumber | 19% MC | Pin-type moisture meter |
| Engineered wood (LVL, TJI) | 16% MC | Pin-type moisture meter |
| Plywood/OSB sheathing | 18% MC | Pin-type moisture meter |
| Drywall (gypsum board) | < 1% MC (manufacturer spec) | Pin-type meter or calcium chloride test |
| Concrete slab (before flooring) | 75% RH (per ASTM F2170) or 3 lbs/1000 SF/24hr (per ASTM F1869) | In-situ RH probe or calcium chloride |
| Insulation (fiberglass/mineral wool) | Dry to touch; no visible moisture | Visual/tactile inspection |

### Mold Discovery Response Protocol

**Step 1: Identification**
- Visual: fuzzy or discolored growth (green, black, white, gray) on surfaces
- Odor: musty, earthy smell in enclosed spaces
- Suspect materials: drywall paper face, wood framing, carpet, insulation, ceiling tile
- Note: Surface staining alone may not indicate active mold — professional assessment needed

**Step 2: Immediate Actions**
1. **Stop work** in affected area
2. **Do not disturb** the mold — disturbance releases spores
3. **Isolate area** with 6-mil poly sheeting and tape
4. **Turn off HVAC** serving affected area (prevents spore distribution)
5. **Restrict access** — only essential personnel
6. **Document** with photos, moisture readings, location description

**Step 3: Professional Assessment**
1. Hire Indoor Environmental Professional (IEP) / Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH)
2. IEP conducts assessment: visual inspection, moisture mapping, air sampling (if needed)
3. IEP identifies mold species, extent of contamination, moisture source
4. IEP develops remediation scope and protocol

**Step 4: Remediation**
- Licensed mold remediation contractor performs work per IEP protocol
- Containment, HEPA filtration, removal of affected materials
- Source of moisture must be identified and corrected (critical — mold will return if source remains)
- Post-remediation verification by IEP (visual + air sampling)
- Documentation filed with project records

**Step 5: Prevention Going Forward**
- Address root cause (roof leak, plumbing leak, inadequate ventilation)
- Monitor moisture levels in affected area
- Increase ventilation/dehumidification as needed
- Brief all trades on mold prevention protocol

### Mold Prevention Checklist (Weekly)

- [ ] Building envelope intact — no water intrusion points
- [ ] Plumbing rough-in pressure tested — no active leaks
- [ ] Absorptive materials stored off ground and covered
- [ ] Drywall moisture content verified before finishing
- [ ] Concrete slab moisture tested before flooring installation
- [ ] HVAC ducts sealed and protected from construction moisture
- [ ] Adequate ventilation in enclosed spaces
- [ ] Dehumidifiers running in high-moisture areas (if applicable)
- [ ] Standing water addressed within 24 hours (48 hours maximum before mold risk)

## 4. Contaminated Soil Discovery Procedures

### Phase I/II ESA Awareness

**What the Superintendent Should Know**:

| Assessment | Purpose | Who Performs | Construction Impact |
|------------|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Phase I ESA | Historical research — identify potential contamination | Environmental consultant (ASTM E1527) | Alerts team to possible contamination areas |
| Phase II ESA | Soil/groundwater sampling — confirm contamination | Environmental consultant (ASTM E1903) | Defines contamination extent, guides excavation plan |
| Phase III | Remediation design | Environmental engineer | May require soil removal, treatment, monitoring |

**Key Information from ESAs**:
- Former land uses (gas stations, dry cleaners, industrial, military, agriculture)
- Known underground storage tanks (USTs)
- Nearby contamination sites (EPA, state databases)
- Areas of concern (AOCs) on the property
- Contamination type and extent (if Phase II completed)

### Unexpected Contamination Discovery Protocol

**Indicators of Contamination**:

| Indicator | Possible Contaminant | Urgency |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| Dark-stained soil (black, oily) | Petroleum, coal tar, creosote | High |
| Strong chemical/solvent odor | VOCs, petroleum, solvents | High — vapor hazard |
| Petroleum sheen on groundwater | Fuel, oil, hydraulic fluid | High — water contamination |
| Buried drums or tanks | Various hazardous substances | Very High — unknown contents |
| White crystalline deposits on soil | Salts, chemical residue | Medium |
| Unusual colored soil (blue, green, red) | Metals, chemicals, industrial waste | High |
| Construction debris with chemical staining | Various | Medium-High |
| Fill material with ash, slag, cinders | Metals, PAHs | Medium |
| Dead vegetation in localized area | Various chemicals | Medium |

## 5. Silica Exposure Prevention (OSHA Table 1)

### What Is Respirable Crystalline Silica?

Crystalline silica (primarily quartz) is present in concrete, morite, stone, brick, and sand. When these materials are cut, drilled, ground, or demolished, fine dust particles become airborne. Particles small enough to reach the deep lungs (respirable fraction, < 10 microns) cause silicosis — an irreversible and potentially fatal lung disease.

### OSHA PEL and Action Level

| Limit | Concentration | Significance |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| PEL (Permissible Exposure Limit) | 50 ug/m3 (8-hour TWA) | Legal limit; must not exceed |
| Action Level | 25 ug/m3 (8-hour TWA) | Triggers medical surveillance if exceeded 30+ days/year |

### Table 1 Controls — Quick Reference Card

**Post this card at tool stations and crew areas**:

| Task | Required Engineering Control | Respiratory Protection |
|------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| Stationary masonry saw | Continuous water feed to blade | None (if water effective) |
| Handheld power saw (concrete/masonry) | Continuous water feed to blade | None (if water effective) |
| Handheld grinder (concrete surface) | Shroud with HEPA vacuum | None (if vacuum effective) |
| Walk-behind floor saw | Continuous water feed | None (if water effective) |
| Concrete core drilling | Continuous water to bit | None (if water effective) |
| Jackhammer/breaker (> 4 hours/day) | Continuous water spray at point of impact | APF 10 respirator (half-face with N95/P100) |
| Jackhammer/breaker (< 4 hours/day) | Continuous water spray at point of impact | None (if water effective) |
| Rotary hammer drill (concrete) | Dust collection with HEPA filter | None (if collection effective) |
| Mortar/concrete mixing (bag) | Use pre-mixed products or enclosed mixer | APF 10 if dust visible |
| Drywall finishing (sanding) | Wet methods or HEPA vacuum sander | APF 10 if dust visible |
| Tuck-pointing/mortar removal | Shroud with HEPA vacuum | APF 10 respirator |
| Demolition (concrete/masonry) | Continuous water spray | APF 10 respirator |

**Key**: APF 10 = Assigned Protection Factor 10 (half-face respirator with N95 or P100 filter).

### Additional OSHA Requirements

**Written Exposure Control Plan**:
- Required for all employers with workers exposed to silica
- Must describe: tasks with silica exposure, engineering controls used, respiratory protection, housekeeping procedures, medical surveillance
- Must be reviewed and updated as conditions change

**Housekeeping**:
- Do NOT dry sweep or use compressed air to clean silica dust
- Use HEPA vacuum or wet sweeping only
- Clean work area at end of each shift

**Medical Surveillance**:
- Required for workers at or above action level (25 ug/m3) for 30+ days/year
- Initial exam within 30 days of initial assignment
- Repeat every 3 years
- Includes: chest X-ray (ILO classification), pulmonary function test, TB screening
- Physician provides written medical opinion on fitness for duty and respirator use

### Exposure Monitoring (When Table 1 Is Not Used)

If employer chooses not to follow Table 1 controls, they must conduct exposure monitoring:
- Initial monitoring for each job task with potential silica exposure
- If initial monitoring shows exposure > action level: repeat every 6 months
- If exposure > PEL: implement additional controls and re-monitor within 6 months
- If two consecutive results below action level: stop monitoring (resume if conditions change)
- Results shared with affected employees within 5 days
