# Certification Tracking Reference

## Overview

Material certifications and test reports are critical documentation that verify materials meet specification requirements. This reference covers what certifications are required for different material types, how to track their status, procedures for verification and acceptance, and how to organize them for project closeout.

**Purpose:** Ensure all required material certifications are received, verified, and properly filed for regulatory compliance and quality assurance.

## Certification Tracking Status Lifecycle

Each material certification follows a defined status path:

### Status Definitions:

1. **Required**
   - Certification identified as required by spec
   - Material being sourced or ordered
   - Action: Verify cert requirement before PO

2. **Requested**
   - PO issued; supplier has been asked to provide cert
   - Material in transit or awaiting delivery
   - Action: Follow up if cert not received with delivery

3. **Received**
   - Cert received from supplier with material delivery
   - Content not yet reviewed against spec
   - Action: Verify cert against spec requirements

4. **Verified**
   - Cert reviewed and confirmed to meet spec requirements
   - Material acceptable for use based on cert
   - Action: File cert in project records

5. **Filed**
   - Cert digitally scanned and physically stored in proper location
   - Cross-referenced in procurement and closeout records
   - Action: Project closeout may proceed

### Status Tracking Workflow:

```

    ↓
Status: REQUIRED
(Spec defines cert needed)
    ↓
PO issued to supplier with cert requirement
    ↓
Status: REQUESTED
(Supplier notified to provide)
    ↓
Material delivered WITH cert attached
    ↓
Status: RECEIVED
(Physical cert in hand)
    ↓
Cert reviewed against spec (Verify action)
    ↓
Status: VERIFIED
(Cert confirms material meets spec)
    ↓
Cert scanned & filed in project system
    ↓
Status: FILED
(Ready for closeout)
```

### Status Tracking in Procurement System:

**Certificate Status Record** should include:
```

## Verification Procedures

### Who Reviews Certifications

**Roles and Responsibilities:**

1. **Superintendent / Project Manager**
   - First review upon material receipt
   - Confirm cert is present and basic completeness
   - No detailed technical evaluation required
   - Responsibility: Ensure material not accepted without cert if required

2. **Quality Control / Quality Assurance Inspector**
   - Detailed technical review of cert content
   - Verify cert values against spec requirements
   - Evaluate if material meets spec minimums
   - Confirm cert is from recognized source (accredited lab, registered mill)
   - Responsibility: Formal certification of cert acceptance

3. **Engineer of Record / Professional Engineer**
   - Reviews for critical materials (structural steel, concrete strength, etc.)
   - May require additional testing if cert raises concerns
   - Approves material use if cert values marginal or conditions present
   - Responsibility: Engineering judgment on cert acceptance

4. **Testing/Inspection Firm**
   - Conducts independent testing if cert is missing or questioned
   - Performs field testing (concrete cores, material sampling, dimensional verification)
   - Issues their own test report as backup cert
   - Responsibility: Third-party verification of material quality

### Verification Procedure Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Visual Inspection of Cert**
- [ ] Cert is original document or certified copy
- [ ] Not excessively faded, creased, or water-damaged (readable)
- [ ] All required fields completed (no blanks)
- [ ] Signed/stamped by authorized representative
- [ ] Lab or mill accreditation mark visible

**Step 2: Identify Test Data**
- [ ] Material identification (spec, grade, size) clearly stated
- [ ] Heat number / batch number / lot number present
- [ ] Test method specified (ASTM standard)
- [ ] Test results stated as numerical values
- [ ] Test date/age of material documented

**Step 3: Cross-Check Against Specification**
- Pull relevant spec section
- Compare cert results to spec requirements:
  - **Grade:** Cert grade ≥ spec grade required
  - **Strength:** Cert values ≥ spec minimum values
  - **Composition:** Cert chemistry meets spec limits
  - **Size:** Cert size matches design requirement
  - **Special requirements:** Fire rating, corrosion resistance, etc.
- Document any deviations

**Step 4: Verify Source Credibility**
- [ ] Lab name and address on cert
- [ ] Accreditation mark visible (ACI, AASHTO, state lab accreditation, AQB)
- [ ] Accreditation scope includes test type being reviewed
- [ ] For mill certs: mill name, location, recognized steel producer
- [ ] For equipment certs: manufacturer is recognized brand
- [ ] Signature/stamp indicates responsible individual (not just company stamp)

**Step 5: Trace to Delivered Material**
- [ ] Material has heat number, batch number, or lot number visible
- [ ] Matches heat number on cert
- [ ] Bundle tag or label matches cert identification
- For equipment: serial number matches cert (if applicable)
- [ ] Quantity delivered matches cert scope

**Step 6: Decision**
Three possible outcomes:

**A) CONFORMING — Material meets specification**
- Cert complete and accurate
- All test results meet spec minimums
- Source is credible and accredited
- Material identification matches cert
- **Action:** Approve material for use; mark cert status as VERIFIED

**B) CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE — Material meets spec with noted conditions**
- Example: Strength value is at minimum spec limit (acceptable but noted)
- Example: Different supplier than typical, but cert is valid
- Example: Test result was marginal but meets requirement
- **Action:** Document condition in approval; flag in closeout records; engineer approval required

**C) NON-CONFORMING — Material does not meet specification**
- Cert shows values below spec minimum
- Wrong grade/type shipped
- Cert from unrecognized source / not accredited
- Material identification does not match cert
- **Action:** Reject material; initiate return; re-order compliant material

## Missing Cert Escalation

When material arrives without required certification:

### Immediate Actions (Within 1 Hour of Discovery)

**Step 1: Verify Requirement**
- Is cert actually required by spec?
- Check spec section for certification requirement language
- Review approved submittal (submittal_log) — does submittal approval note cert requirement?
- Confirm with engineer of record if unclear

**Step 2: Search for Cert**
- Check all packaging and paperwork again (may be in separate envelope)
- Contact delivery driver (may have left at warehouse)
- Call material supplier to determine if cert is in separate shipment
- Get timeline for cert arrival

**Step 3: Document Status**
- Photograph material and missing cert status
- Record discovery date/time
- Note material identification (serial #, model, batch, heat #, etc.) for later matching
- Update material-tracker: cert_status = "missing - escalated"

### Notification Timeline

**Immediately (same day):**
- Contact material supplier/manufacturer
- Request expedited cert submission
- Establish expected delivery date for cert
- Get commitment in writing (email acceptable)

**Within 24 Hours:**
- Notify superintendent and QC inspector
- Notify engineer of record (may need decision on hold vs. conditional use)
- Determine if material can be stored safely pending cert

**Within 48 Hours:**
- If cert not received: Evaluate alternative actions:
  - Hold material on site until cert received (preferred)
  - Return material and re-order from alternate supplier
  - Commission independent testing (if time-critical and material value justifies)
  - Proceed with conditional acceptance (engineer approval required, with caveat)

### Hold on Installation

**Material subject to hold if:**
- Cert required by spec
- Cert not received
- Hold period expires: typically 2-3 weeks from delivery date
- Material value or criticality justifies holding

**Hold status:**
- Do not install or incorporate into work
- Keep material segregated/identified (label "HOLD - Awaiting Cert")
- Protect from weather and damage
- Daily log notes: "Material on hold - cert pending"

**Hold termination options:**
1. **Cert received** — Verify and clear for installation
2. **Return** — Supplier takes material back, refunds/credits PO
3. **Accept with waiver** — Engineer approves use without cert (unusual; documented exception)
4. **Independent testing** — Third-party lab tests material in lieu of missing cert

### Escalation Example:

```
Material: Structural Steel Beam (W12x40)
PO: PO-2024-0456
Delivery Date: March 1, 2024
Cert Status: MISSING (Mill cert not included with shipment)

Day 1 (March 1, 2024):
  - Delivery received without mill cert
  - Supplier contacted: "Cert mailed separately, expected March 4"
  - Material stored on racks, protected with tarp
  - QC notified; material flagged as "hold - cert pending"

Day 4 (March 4, 2024):
  - Cert still not received
  - Follow-up email to supplier
  - Supplier response: "Cert was mailed March 1; confirm receipt"
  - Check mail/office files: not received

Day 5 (March 5, 2024):
  - Supplier re-sends cert via overnight courier
  - Requested expedited delivery
  - Engineer of record notified of delay impact on schedule

Day 6 (March 6, 2024):
  - Cert received and verified
  - QC reviews and approves: "All values meet spec"
  - Material cleared for installation
  - Installation proceeds

Status Change Log:
  March 1: Cert_Status = "received, incomplete"
  March 1: Cert_Status = "missing - escalated"
  March 6: Cert_Status = "verified"
  March 6: Cert_Status = "filed"
```
