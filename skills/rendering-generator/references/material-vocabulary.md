# Material Vocabulary: Specification Language to Visual Prompt Translation

This guide translates construction specification language into visual prompt language that AI models can understand and render accurately. AI models do not recognize abbreviations (ACT, GWB, VCT, LVP) or technical specification terms; they need descriptive visual language.

## Translation Format

Each entry follows this structure:
- **Specification Term**: Industry-standard abbreviation or term used in construction documents
- **Visual Prompt Language**: Descriptive phrase suitable for AI image generation
- **Color/Finish Notes**: Typical aesthetic appearance and common finishes
- **Avoid Language**: Common mistakes in describing this material

## Prompt Construction Tips

1. **Avoid abbreviations in prompts**: Never use GWB, ACT, VCT, LVP, CMU, EPDM, TPO, FRP, or other abbreviations. Use the visual description instead.

2. **Be specific about color**: Don't say "gray concrete"; say "light gray polished concrete" or "medium gray textured concrete."

3. **Describe texture**: Is it smooth, textured, rippled, ribbed, rough, polished, or matte? Texture is critical to visual realism.

4. **Include finish sheen**: Matte, satin, glossy, or reflective? The finish dramatically affects appearance.

5. **Reference proportions when helpful**: "Small 2x2 ceiling tiles" vs. "large 2x4 ceiling tiles" helps establish scale.

6. **Show material interactions**: How does the material meet adjacent materials? "Dark baseboard trim at white drywall" creates visual hierarchy.

7. **Test with real examples**: If uncertain about a term, describe it as "similar to [common reference]" to guide the AI.

8. **Match regional conventions**: Some regions favor certain materials; be aware of local conventions (e.g., brick common in certain areas, stucco/EIFS in others).
