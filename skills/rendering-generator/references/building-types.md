# Building Types: Rendering Prompt Adjustment Guide

This guide specifies how rendering prompts should be modified based on building type. Each type has distinct visual characteristics, material expressions, and compositional strategies that must be reflected in AI-generated renderings.

## PEMB / Pre-Engineered Metal Building

**Key Visual Characteristics:**
- Crisp, clearly articulated panel lines running horizontally (wall) or along purlins (roof)
- Standing seam roof with pronounced parallel ridges and seam lines
- Large clear-span interior volumes evident in the form (wide spans, minimal interior columns)
- Linear fastener patterns visible along panel edges (typically every 12-16 inches)
- Consistent ribbing or fluting pattern on corrugated or textured panels
- Gable or shallow-slope roofline expressing the rigid frame structure
- Industrial character balanced with the building's use (healthcare, office, etc.)

**Material Tendencies:**
- Wall panels: typically galvanized steel or painted steel, often light gray, silver, or tan
- Roof: standing seam metal, usually light reflective color (white, silver, light gray, or charcoal)
- Trim: painted steel, aluminum storefronts at entry, possible masonry or curtain wall infill
- Base: may have masonry or metal wainscot to ground level

**Scale Cues:**
- Clear delineation of building components (columns, beams, bracing) even if partially obscured
- Human figures at entries show the scale of the clear-span volume above
- Vehicle/parking context shows the footprint extent
- Shadows cast by the form reveal the depth and height

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Panel lines should NOT be random or irregular; they follow a precise grid pattern
- Fastener lines must be visible but not dominate; they reinforce the panel grid, not replace it
- Avoid treating the roof as smooth or seamless; standing seam creates visual rhythm
- Do NOT show architectural ornamentation or curves that contradict the industrial aesthetic
- Avoid heavy shadows that obscure the panel geometry

**Example Prompt Fragments:**
- "precise horizontal corrugated metal panels with clearly visible fastener lines every 12 inches"
- "standing seam metal roof with prominent parallel ridges and seam lines creating rhythm"
- "light gray galvanized steel walls with crisp panel lines and consistent ribbing pattern"
- "large clear span interior volume evident in the form, industrial yet functional"
- "gable roof with clean metal edges and predictable structural expression"

## Summary: Prompt Engineering Best Practices by Type

1. **Research the type first**: Understand the specific functional and aesthetic requirements before constructing the prompt.
2. **Emphasize distinctive features**: Each type has signature elements; make them prominent and clearly rendered.
3. **Balance function and form**: Show how the design serves its purpose while expressing architectural intent.
4. **Include human scale**: Use figures, vehicles, or activity to ground the rendering in reality.
5. **Context matters**: Show how the building relates to its setting and community.
6. **Avoid type-specific clichés**: Don't resort to stereotypes; use descriptive, specific language instead.
7. **Test and iterate**: If a rendering misses the type's character, refine the prompt with more specific material or compositional language.
