# Labor Tracking Skill for Foreman OS

## Overview

The **labor-tracking** skill provides comprehensive labor hour management and productivity analysis for construction projects. It enables daily labor data entry, crew-level summary tracking, worker classification management, and automated cross-validation against daily reports. The skill calculates labor productivity ratios, supports Davis-Bacon certified payroll compliance, and integrates with earned-value management (EVM) for actual cost (AC) calculations.

### Core Functions

- **Daily Labor Entry**: Log worker hours by trade, classification, and cost code
- **Crew Management**: Track crew composition, headcount, and work accomplished
- **Productivity Metrics**: Calculate output-per-labor-hour ratios and efficiency factors
- **Weekly Summaries**: Aggregate hours, costs, and trends by trade
- **Daily Report Validation**: Cross-check labor entries against crew counts in daily reports
- **Certified Payroll**: Generate Davis-Bacon WH-347 form data and prevailing wage tracking
- **Cost Integration**: Feed actual labor costs into EVM and project dashboard

## 3. Productivity Metrics

### Labor Productivity Ratio Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Productivity Ratio = Units of Output ÷ Total Labor-Hours

Labor Efficiency Factor = Actual Productivity Ratio ÷ Benchmark Ratio
```

### Benchmark Standards by Trade

| Trade | Output Unit | Benchmark Ratio | Basis | Notes |
|-------|------------|-----------------|-------|-------|
| Concrete (Footings) | Linear feet of footing | 3.25 LF/hr | Industry standard | Excavation, rebar, formwork, pour |
| Concrete (SOG) | Square feet poured | 120 SF/hr | Structural slab | Finishing included |
| Steel Erection | Tons hoisted | 2.5 T/hr | PEMB assembly | Includes bolting |
| CFS Framing | Studs installed | 15 studs/hr | Metal framing @ 16" OC | Interior partitions |
| Drywall | Square feet hung | 85 SF/hr | Hanging only | Finishing separate |
| MEP Rough-In | Linear feet of pipe/ductwork | 45 LF/hr | Combined MEP | Average across trades |
| Roofing | Square feet installed | 35 SF/hr | Panel install + fastening | Metal standing seam |
| Finishes | Square feet finished | 120 SF/hr | Paint + trim | Both walls and trim |

### Weekly Productivity Tracking

```json
{
  "week": "2026-02-17 to 2026-02-23",
  "trade": "Concrete",
  "entries": 5,
  "productivity_data": [
    {
      "date": "2026-02-19",
      "crew": "CRW-2026-02-19-CONCRETE-01",
      "ratio": 2.99,
      "benchmark": 3.25,
      "efficiency": 0.92
    },
    {
      "date": "2026-02-20",
      "crew": "CRW-2026-02-20-CONCRETE-01",
      "ratio": 3.18,
      "benchmark": 3.25,
      "efficiency": 0.98
    }
  ],
  "weekly_average_efficiency": 0.95,
  "trend": "steady",
  "forecast": "On track for weekly target"
}
```

### Earned Hours vs Actual Hours (Labor Efficiency)

```
Earned Hours = Standard Hours × Efficiency Factor
Labor Cost Variance = (Actual Hours - Earned Hours) × Burdened Rate

If Crew 1: 50 actual hours, 3.0 ratio actual vs 3.25 benchmark
  Earned Hours = 50 × (3.0 ÷ 3.25) = 46.15 hours
  Over-run = 3.85 labor-hours
  Cost Variance = 3.85 × $78.75 = $303.19 unfavorable

## 5. Daily Report Cross-Validation

### Validation Workflow

The labor-tracking skill automatically compares daily labor entries against crew counts reported in daily reports. This ensures consistency and flags discrepancies for investigation.

#### Validation Rules

```json
{
  "validation_rules": [
    {
      "rule_id": "VR-001",
      "name": "Crew Size Match",
      "logic": "Count of unique workers logged in labor entries == reported crew size in daily report",
      "tolerance": 0,
      "action": "Flag if mismatch"
    },
    {
      "rule_id": "VR-002",
