## 1. SCOPE COMPARISON METHODOLOGY

### Creating the Scope Matrix

The scope comparison matrix is the single most important tool for evaluating subcontractor bids. Without it, you are comparing prices without knowing whether bidders are pricing the same work. A $50,000 difference between two bidders often has nothing to do with efficiency or profit -- it reflects different scope assumptions.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Step 1 -- Build the Scope Item List:**
- Open the specification section for the trade being bid
- List every scope item described in the specification
- Add items from the drawings that may not be in the spec (backing, blocking, cutouts)
- Add general items that apply to all trades (cleanup, protection, hoisting, layout, permits)
- Add project-specific items (phasing, overtime, restricted access, security)
- Organize items logically: mobilization, materials, labor activities, equipment, closeout

**Step 2 -- Review Each Bid:**
- Read the entire bid, including the fine print, qualifications, and exclusions
- For each scope item on your list, determine whether the bidder has:
  - **Included (I)**: Explicitly included or clearly part of their work
  - **Excluded (E)**: Explicitly excluded in their qualifications
  - **Qualified (Q)**: Included with conditions or limitations
  - **Not Addressed (N/A)**: Neither included nor excluded -- requires clarification

**Step 3 -- Populate the Matrix:**
- Create a spreadsheet with scope items as rows and bidders as columns
- Mark each cell with I, E, Q, or N/A
- Add a notes column for each bidder to capture qualifications
- Highlight all E, Q, and N/A cells -- these are the items that make bids non-comparable

**Step 4 -- Normalize the Bids:**
- For each excluded or qualified item, determine the cost to fill the gap
- Get a price from another bidder, estimate it yourself, or request a revised bid
- Add gap costs to each bidder's base price to create an "apples-to-apples" comparison
- This normalized price is the true comparison number

### Inclusion/Exclusion Tracking

**Common Exclusions That Significantly Affect Price:**

| Trade | Commonly Excluded Item | Typical Cost Impact |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Concrete | Pump rental | $3,000-$8,000/day |
| Concrete | Winter protection | $5,000-$20,000/month |
| Concrete | Waterproofing additives | $15-$30/CY |
| Structural Steel | Fireproofing | $2-$5/SF |
| Structural Steel | Touch-up painting | $0.50-$1.50/SF |
| HVAC | Controls/BAS | 10-20% of HVAC cost |
| HVAC | Testing and balancing | 3-5% of HVAC cost |
| HVAC | Commissioning support | $5,000-$20,000 |
| Electrical | Low-voltage wiring | Varies widely |
| Electrical | Fire alarm | Often separate specialty |
| Plumbing | Excavation/backfill | $20-$50/LF |
| Plumbing | Insulation | $3-$8/LF |
| Roofing | Sheet metal flashings | $15-$40/LF |

## 3. COMMON BID QUALIFICATIONS

### Schedule Assumptions

Bidders frequently include schedule qualifications that can dramatically affect the real cost:

| Qualification | Risk to GC | How to Address |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| "Based on continuous, uninterrupted access" | If access is interrupted, expect a change order | Clarify phasing/access in pre-bid and include realistic access schedule |
| "Based on normal working hours (M-F, 7-3:30)" | Any overtime/shift work will be extra | Discuss schedule expectations before award |
| "Work to be completed in one mobilization" | If work is phased, expect re-mobilization charges | Define phasing requirements clearly |
| "Based on X weeks duration" | If project delays extend their time, expect extended general conditions | Include schedule in subcontract |
| "Assumes availability of crane/hoist" | If GC crane is not available, sub will charge for their own | Clarify crane sharing schedule |

### Material Substitutions

| Qualification | Risk | How to Address |
|--------------|------|----------------|
| "Or equal" | Substitution may not meet spec performance | Require submittal before acceptance |
| Specific manufacturer named (different from spec) | May not be approved by architect | Verify acceptability before award |
| "Domestic materials" or "imported materials" | Cost and lead time differences | Clarify Buy America/domestic requirements |
| "Based on current material pricing" | Escalation risk if award is delayed | Include price validity period |

### Payment Terms

| Qualification | Risk | How to Address |
|--------------|------|----------------|
| "Progress payments every 2 weeks" | More frequent than typical monthly billing cycle | Align with your billing cycle |
| "10% retainage maximum" | May differ from your retainage terms | Match to prime contract terms |
| "Mobilization payment of X% at NTP" | Front-loaded payment before work starts | Negotiate or require bond |
| "Material stored off-site to be paid at 100%" | Risk of paying for undelivered material | Require proof of storage and insurance |
| "Final payment within 15 days of completion" | Faster than typical final payment timeline | Align with prime contract closeout |

### Exclusions That Change the Price

**Critical Exclusions to Watch For:**
- Overtime labor: If the project requires weekend or overtime work, and the bid excludes it, the cost delta can be 25-50% of labor
- Winter conditions: Heating, hoarding, thawing, and reduced productivity can add 15-30% to affected work
- Hazardous materials: Abatement, encapsulation, or special handling can be significant in renovation
- Temporary power/water: If the sub expects the GC to provide, it is a GC general conditions cost
- Testing and inspection: Third-party testing can be $50-$200+ per test
- Permits and fees: Building permits, specialty permits, inspection fees

## 4. UNIT PRICE REASONABLENESS CHECK

### Benchmark Ranges by Trade

Use these ranges to flag outlier unit prices that warrant investigation. Prices significantly below the range may indicate a scope gap, error, or "buy-in" strategy. Prices significantly above may indicate misunderstanding, conservative pricing, or overhead burden.

**Order-of-Magnitude Unit Prices (Verify Against Local Market):**

| Trade/Activity | Unit | Low Range | Mid Range | High Range |
|---------------|------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Site clearing (light) | AC | $2,000 | $4,000 | $8,000 |
| Mass excavation (common earth) | CY | $5 | $10 | $20 |
| Aggregate base (6") | SF | $1.00 | $1.75 | $3.00 |
| Asphalt paving (2" overlay) | SF | $1.50 | $2.50 | $4.00 |
| Concrete (CIP, all-in, foundations) | CY | $400 | $650 | $900 |
| Concrete (CIP, all-in, elevated slab) | CY | $500 | $800 | $1,200 |
| Structural steel (erected) | TON | $3,500 | $5,000 | $6,500 |
| CMU wall (8", reinforced, grouted) | SF | $12 | $17 | $22 |
| Brick veneer (installed) | SF | $15 | $25 | $40 |
| Metal stud + GWB (both sides, L4, paint) | SF | $8 | $12 | $16 |
| ACT ceiling (2x4 grid + tile) | SF | $3 | $5 | $7 |
| Ceramic floor tile (12x12 standard) | SF | $8 | $13 | $18 |
| LVT flooring (installed) | SF | $4 | $6 | $9 |
| Interior painting (2 coats, walls) | SF | $1.50 | $2.25 | $3.00 |
| TPO roofing (60 mil, complete system) | SQ | $600 | $800 | $1,000 |
| HVAC (office, per SF) | SF | $15 | $22 | $35 |
| HVAC (per ton, includes ductwork) | TON | $3,000 | $4,500 | $6,000 |
| Electrical (office, per SF) | SF | $12 | $18 | $25 |
| Plumbing (per fixture, complete) | FIX | $2,500 | $3,750 | $5,000 |
| Fire sprinkler (light hazard, per head) | HEAD | $200 | $300 | $400 |
| Fire sprinkler (per SF building) | SF | $2.50 | $4.00 | $6.00 |

### When a Price is "Too Low"

A bid that is significantly below competitors (>15-20% below average) should raise concerns:

**Potential Explanations for Low Bids:**
1. **Scope gap**: The most common reason. The bidder has excluded significant scope items
2. **Estimating error**: The bidder made a math mistake or missed a quantity
3. **Buy-in strategy**: The bidder intentionally prices low to win the job, then makes profit on change orders
4. **Desperation**: The bidder needs work to cover overhead and is willing to take a loss
5. **Efficiency**: The bidder genuinely has a cost advantage (proprietary method, low overhead, local labor)

**How to Investigate:**
- Run the scope matrix -- does the low bidder exclude items others include?
- Compare unit prices item by item -- is one particular item drastically different?
- Ask the bidder to confirm their price and scope in writing
- Check the bidder's recent project history -- are they finishing projects or leaving them?
- Request a detailed breakdown to verify quantities and productivity assumptions

**Risk of Awarding to a "Too Low" Bidder:**
- Change order claims for items "not included"
- Quality shortcuts to maintain margin
- Slow payment to their suppliers and sub-subs
- Abandonment if losses become unsustainable
- Liens from unpaid suppliers

## 7. BEST VALUE SELECTION

### Beyond Lowest Price

Lowest price selection works for commodity purchases where all products are identical. Construction subcontracting is not a commodity -- the contractor's experience, personnel, safety culture, financial stability, and management capability directly affect project outcomes.

Best value selection uses a weighted evaluation to balance price against qualitative factors.

### Weighted Evaluation Methodology

**Step 1 -- Define Criteria and Weights:**
The project team (superintendent, PM, estimator) agrees on evaluation criteria and weights before bids are opened. This prevents bias in weighting after prices are known.

**Step 2 -- Score Each Criterion:**
Each criterion is scored on a 1-5 or 1-10 scale based on objective evidence (bid analysis, reference checks, safety records, financial statements).

**Step 3 -- Calculate Weighted Score:**
Multiply each score by the weight, sum for total weighted score.

**Step 4 -- Compare Total Scores:**
The bidder with the highest total weighted score represents the best value.

**Example Weighted Evaluation:**

| Criterion | Weight | Bidder A Score | A Weighted | Bidder B Score | B Weighted | Bidder C Score | C Weighted |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Price competitiveness | 35% | 9 | 3.15 | 7 | 2.45 | 10 | 3.50 |
| Relevant experience | 20% | 8 | 1.60 | 10 | 2.00 | 5 | 1.00 |
| Key personnel | 15% | 7 | 1.05 | 9 | 1.35 | 6 | 0.90 |
| Safety record | 15% | 9 | 1.35 | 8 | 1.20 | 4 | 0.60 |
| Schedule capability | 10% | 7 | 0.70 | 9 | 0.90 | 7 | 0.70 |
| Financial strength | 5% | 8 | 0.40 | 9 | 0.45 | 6 | 0.30 |
| **Total** | **100%** | | **8.25** | | **8.35** | | **7.00** |

*In this example, Bidder B wins on best value despite not being the lowest price (Bidder C). Bidder B's superior experience, personnel, and safety record justify the price premium.*

**Price Scoring Methods:**

Method 1 -- Lowest Price Gets Maximum Score:
```
Score = (Lowest Bid / This Bid) x Maximum Points
Example: Lowest bid = $500K, This bid = $550K
Score = ($500K / $550K) x 10 = 9.1
```

Method 2 -- Range-Based Scoring:
```
Score = Maximum Points x (Highest Bid - This Bid) / (Highest Bid - Lowest Bid)
Normalizes all bids between the high and low
```

## 8. BID TABULATION FORMAT

### Standard Bid Tab Layout

The bid tabulation (bid tab) is the formal record of all bids received. It serves as documentation for the selection decision and should be retained in the project file.

**Bid Tab Header:**
```
BID TABULATION
Project: ____________________________     Bid Number: ____________
Trade: ______________________________     Spec Section: __________
Bid Date: ___________________________     Bid Time: ______________
Bids Received By: ___________________     Bids Opened By: ________
```

**Bid Tab Columns:**

| # | Bidder | Base Bid | Alt 1 (+/-) | Alt 2 (+/-) | Alt 3 (+/-) | Unit Prices | Addenda | Bond | Scope Gaps | Adjusted Total | Rank |
|---|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|------|-----------|----------------|------|
| 1 | | $ | $ | $ | $ | See detail | 1,2,3 | Y/N | $ | $ | |
| 2 | | $ | $ | $ | $ | See detail | 1,2,3 | Y/N | $ | $ | |
| 3 | | $ | $ | $ | $ | See detail | 1,2,3 | Y/N | $ | $ | |
| 4 | | $ | $ | $ | $ | See detail | 1,2,3 | Y/N | $ | $ | |

### Reconciliation Process

After completing the bid tab, reconcile all bids:

1. **Verify arithmetic**: Check extensions (unit price x quantity) and totals
2. **Confirm addenda**: All bidders must acknowledge all addenda; failure to acknowledge may require rejection
3. **Compare to estimate**: How do bids compare to the pre-bid estimate? If all bids are significantly higher, re-evaluate scope or budget
4. **Identify outliers**: Flag bids that are >20% above or below the average
5. **Request clarifications**: For any N/A or Q items, request written clarification before making a selection
6. **Document decision**: Record the basis for selection (lowest price, best value, or other) in the bid tab notes

### Bid Tab Best Practices

**Before Bid Opening:**
- Verify all bids were received before the deadline
- Confirm all bid packages are sealed (if sealed bid process)
- Prepare the blank bid tab template with all bidder names

**During Bid Opening:**
- Read base bids aloud (if public opening)
- Record all alternates, unit prices, and qualifications
- Note any missing items (unsigned bid, missing bond, missing addenda acknowledgment)

**After Bid Opening:**
- Complete the scope comparison matrix
- Calculate adjusted totals
- Contact low bidders to verify their price ("Did you intend to bid $X?")
- Document all clarification conversations in writing
- Present recommendation to the project team with supporting analysis
- Obtain required approvals before issuing letter of intent or subcontract

### Documentation Retention

Maintain the following in the project file for each bid package:
- Original bid tab
- All bid proposals received (including rejected bids)
- Scope comparison matrix
- Clarification correspondence
- Reference check notes
- Pre-qualification questionnaires and evaluations
- Selection recommendation memo
- Approval documentation
- Letter of intent / subcontract
