## 1. LABOR COST CALCULATION

### Base Wage by Trade

Labor is the largest single cost component in most construction activities, typically representing 40-60% of direct cost. Understanding labor cost calculation is essential for verifying any estimate or change order price.

**Example Base Wage Rates (Verify Against Local Market and Prevailing Wage):**

| Trade | Journeyman Rate (Non-Union Example) | Journeyman Rate (Union Example) | Apprentice Rate (Typical) |
|-------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Laborer | $22-$32/hr | $30-$42/hr | 50-80% of journeyman |
| Carpenter | $28-$40/hr | $38-$52/hr | 50-80% of journeyman |
| Electrician | $30-$45/hr | $42-$58/hr | 40-80% of journeyman |
| Plumber | $32-$48/hr | $45-$62/hr | 40-80% of journeyman |
| Pipefitter | $32-$48/hr | $44-$60/hr | 40-80% of journeyman |
| Sheet Metal Worker | $30-$46/hr | $42-$58/hr | 40-80% of journeyman |
| Ironworker | $32-$50/hr | $45-$65/hr | 50-80% of journeyman |
| Operating Engineer | $30-$48/hr | $42-$62/hr | 50-80% of journeyman |
| Painter | $24-$35/hr | $32-$48/hr | 50-80% of journeyman |
| Cement Mason/Finisher | $26-$38/hr | $36-$52/hr | 50-80% of journeyman |
| Roofer | $25-$38/hr | $35-$50/hr | 50-80% of journeyman |
| Tile Setter | $28-$42/hr | $38-$55/hr | 50-80% of journeyman |
| Glazier | $28-$40/hr | $38-$52/hr | 50-80% of journeyman |
| Insulator | $26-$38/hr | $36-$50/hr | 50-80% of journeyman |

*These are illustrative ranges. Actual rates vary significantly by geographic region, market conditions, and project type. Always verify against local market data or published prevailing wage determinations.*

### Burden Calculation Worksheet

Use this worksheet to calculate the fully burdened labor rate from a base wage:

**Step 1 -- Start with Base Wage:**
```
Base Wage:                          $______/hr
```

**Step 2 -- Calculate Statutory Burdens:**
```
FICA (Social Security + Medicare):    7.65% x Base = $______/hr
FUTA (Federal Unemployment):          0.6% x Base = $______/hr  (on first $7,000 annual)
SUTA (State Unemployment):            ____% x Base = $______/hr  (varies by state/employer)
Workers' Compensation:                ____% x Base = $______/hr  (varies by trade/state/EMR)
General Liability Insurance:          ____% x Base = $______/hr  (varies by trade)
```

**Step 3 -- Calculate Fringe Benefits:**
```
Health Insurance:                     $______/hr  (monthly premium / 173 hours)
Pension/401k:                         ____% x Base = $______/hr
Training/Apprenticeship Fund:         $______/hr  (union) or ____% x Base
Vacation/Holiday Pay:                 ____% x Base = $______/hr
Annuity (union):                      $______/hr
```

**Step 4 -- Calculate Incidentals:**
```

PPE (employer-provided):              $______/hr
Travel/Subsistence (if applicable):   $______/hr
```

**Step 5 -- Total Burden:**
```
Total Burden per Hour:                $______/hr
Burden as % of Base:                  ______%
Fully Burdened Rate:                  $______/hr  (Base + Total Burden)
Burden Multiplier:                    ______x     (Burdened Rate / Base Wage)
```

| **Total Burden** | **$9.89/hr** | |
| **Burdened Rate** | **$33.89/hr** | |
| **Burden Multiplier** | **1.41x** | |

### Prevailing Wage Awareness

On federally funded projects (Davis-Bacon Act) and many state/local public projects, workers must be paid the prevailing wage rate as determined by the Department of Labor.

**Key Points:**
- Prevailing wage includes both base rate and fringe benefits
- Fringe can be paid as cash or as benefits (health, pension, vacation)
- Rates are published by trade classification and geographic area
- Misclassification of workers is a common compliance issue (paying laborer rate for journeyman work)
- Certified payroll reporting is required weekly
- Non-compliance can result in contract termination, debarment, and penalties

**Superintendent's Role:**
- Verify worker classifications on subcontractor daily reports match the work being performed
- Review certified payroll reports for accuracy
- Report suspected prevailing wage violations to the project manager
- Ensure your own self-perform crews are correctly classified and paid

## 2. MATERIAL COST COMPONENTS

### Supply Pricing

Material cost includes more than the unit price of the product. A complete material cost assessment includes:

**Price Components:**

| Component | Description | Typical Impact |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Base material price | Manufacturer list or distributor price | 100% (base) |
| Volume discount | Quantity break from supplier | -5% to -20% |
| Project discount | Negotiated project-specific pricing | -3% to -15% |
| Payment terms discount | 2% net 10 or similar | -1% to -2% |
| Delivery charge | Freight to jobsite | +2% to +8% |
| Sales tax | State and local tax | +4% to +10% |
| Waste factor | Material lost to cutting, damage, spillage | +3% to +30% |
| Storage/handling | Temporary storage, double-handling | +1% to +5% |
| Return/restocking | Fees for returning unused material | +1% to +3% |

### Delivery Considerations

- Standard delivery: included in material price from local suppliers
- Special delivery: crane offload, inside delivery, specific floor placement -- additional charge
- Just-in-time delivery: reduces storage cost but increases delivery frequency
- Phased delivery: matches installation schedule, avoids large stockpiles
- Minimum order charges: small quantities may trigger minimum delivery fees
- Lead time: long-lead items (switchgear, elevators, custom fabrication) require early ordering

### Sales Tax

- Rates vary by state, county, and city (0% to 10%+)
- Some states exempt construction materials (check jurisdiction)
- Tax-exempt projects (government, non-profit) require proper documentation
- Tax on installed materials vs. fabricated materials can differ
- Always verify the applicable rate -- using the wrong rate on a $1M material package = $10K error per 1% difference

### Waste Factors

Waste is an unavoidable cost of construction. The waste factor accounts for material that is purchased but does not end up installed in the final product.

**Sources of Waste:**
- Cutting: material removed to achieve required dimensions (perimeter cuts, notches, penetrations)
- Breakage: damaged during shipping, handling, or installation
- Defects: material that does not meet quality standards
- Over-ordering: purchasing more than needed as insurance
- Spoilage: material that exceeds shelf life or is damaged by weather/improper storage
- Theft: unfortunately a reality on construction sites

**Waste Factor Application:**
```
Order Quantity = Installed Quantity x (1 + Waste Factor)
Example: 10,000 SF of drywall x (1 + 0.07) = 10,700 SF ordered
```

## 3. EQUIPMENT COST CALCULATION

### Ownership vs. Rental Decision

**Ownership Cost Components (Hourly):**
```
Depreciation:    (Purchase Price - Salvage Value) / (Useful Life in Hours)
Interest:        (Average Investment x Annual Rate) / Annual Hours
Insurance:       Annual Premium / Annual Hours
Tax:             Annual Tax / Annual Hours
Storage:         Annual Cost / Annual Hours
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Ownership Cost per Hour = Sum of above
```

**Rental Cost Components (Hourly):**
```
Rental Rate:     Monthly Rate / 176 hours (or daily rate / 8 hours)
Delivery:        Mob + Demob / Total Rental Hours
Damage Waiver:   Per rental agreement (typically 10-15% of rental rate)
Fuel:            Consumption Rate x Fuel Price
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Rental Cost per Hour = Sum of above
```

**Decision Matrix:**

| Factor | Favors Ownership | Favors Rental |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Duration of need | >6 months | <3 months |
| Utilization rate | >60-70% | <50% |
| Maintenance capability | In-house mechanics | No shop capability |
| Capital availability | Strong cash/credit | Limited capital |
| Technology change | Stable equipment type | Rapidly evolving |
| Fleet management | Multiple units needed | One-off requirement |
| Tax benefit | Depreciation valuable | Expense deduction preferred |

### Hourly Cost Calculation Example

**Example: 30-Ton Hydraulic Excavator**

**Ownership Scenario:**
```
Purchase Price:           $280,000
Salvage Value:            $56,000  (20% after 10,000 hours)
Useful Life:              10,000 hours
Annual Hours:             1,500 hours
Annual Insurance:         $5,600
Annual Tax:               $2,800
Interest Rate:            6%

Depreciation:             ($280,000 - $56,000) / 10,000 = $22.40/hr
Interest:                 ($168,000 avg x 6%) / 1,500 = $6.72/hr
Insurance:                $5,600 / 1,500 = $3.73/hr
Tax:                      $2,800 / 1,500 = $1.87/hr
Ownership Cost:           $34.72/hr

Operating Costs:
Fuel:                     6 gal/hr x $4.50/gal = $27.00/hr
Maintenance/Repair:       $15.00/hr (reserve)
Tires/Tracks:             $3.50/hr (amortized)
Operating Cost:           $45.50/hr

Total Ownership Cost:     $80.22/hr (excluding operator)
```

**Rental Scenario:**
```
Monthly Rental:           $12,000/month
Delivery (mob + demob):   $2,500 round trip
Damage Waiver:            $1,200/month
Duration:                 3 months

Rental:                   $12,000 / 176 hrs = $68.18/hr
Delivery:                 $2,500 / (176 x 3) = $4.73/hr
Damage Waiver:            $1,200 / 176 = $6.82/hr
Fuel:                     6 gal/hr x $4.50 = $27.00/hr
Total Rental Cost:        $106.73/hr (excluding operator)
```

*In this example, ownership is cheaper per hour ($80.22 vs. $106.73), but only if the machine is utilized enough hours to justify the capital investment.*

### Mobilization and Demobilization

| Equipment Category | Typical Mob/Demob Cost | Transport Method |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Skid steer/mini excavator | $300-$800 | Trailer |
| Backhoe loader | $500-$1,200 | Low-boy |
| Excavator (20-30 ton) | $1,000-$3,000 | Low-boy |
| Excavator (35-50 ton) | $2,000-$5,000 | Low-boy |
| Dozer (D5-D6) | $1,500-$3,500 | Low-boy |
| Dozer (D8-D9) | $3,000-$7,000 | Low-boy |
| Crane (50-100 ton) | $5,000-$15,000 | Self-propelled or transport |
| Crane (200+ ton) | $15,000-$50,000+ | Multiple transport loads |
| Tower crane | $25,000-$75,000+ | Erection/dismantlement |
| Piling rig | $10,000-$30,000 | Transport + setup |
| Batch plant (portable) | $15,000-$40,000 | Transport + setup |

### Fuel Consumption Estimation

**Quick Estimation Method:**
```
Fuel Consumption (gal/hr) = HP x Load Factor x Fuel Factor

Where:
HP = Rated horsepower of engine
Load Factor = Average percentage of full power used
  - Light work: 0.40-0.55
  - Medium work: 0.55-0.70
  - Heavy work: 0.70-0.85
Fuel Factor = 0.04 gal/HP-hr (diesel engines, approximate)
```

**Example: 200 HP Excavator, Medium Work**
```
Consumption = 200 x 0.60 x 0.04 = 4.8 gal/hr
At $4.50/gal: $21.60/hr fuel cost
```

## 4. OVERHEAD CALCULATION

### Job Overhead (General Conditions) Line Items

Job overhead (also called general conditions or general requirements) includes all project-specific costs that are not directly attributable to a specific trade activity. These costs are real and significant -- typically 8-15% of direct construction cost.

**Detailed Job Overhead Checklist:**

**Personnel:**
- Superintendent salary and benefits (full-time on site)
- Assistant superintendent (if required)
- Project manager allocation (portion of time)
- Project engineer/coordinator
- Field office administrative support
- Safety manager/officer (full or part-time)

**Facilities and Temporary Construction:**
- Field office trailer (lease, delivery, setup, removal)
- Storage containers/trailers
- Temporary power (poles, panels, distribution, monthly utility)
- Temporary water (connection, piping, monthly utility)
- Temporary telephone/internet/data
- Temporary toilets (quantity based on workforce size)
- Temporary fencing (installation, rental, removal)
- Temporary roads/access (construction, maintenance)
- Temporary signage (project identification, wayfinding, safety)

**Waste Management:**
- Dumpsters/roll-offs (rental, hauling, disposal fees)
- Recycling containers (if required)
- Hazardous waste disposal (if applicable)
- Clean-up labor (daily and final)

**Safety and Protection:**
- Safety equipment (barricades, signs, fall protection, guardrails)
- PPE supply (hard hats, vests, glasses, gloves for visitors/new hires)
- First aid supplies and station
- Fire extinguishers and fire watch
- Winter protection (heating, hoarding, enclosures)
- Dust control (water truck, sweeping, air filtration)
- Noise control (sound barriers, scheduling restrictions)

**Insurance and Bonds:**
- Builder's risk insurance
- OCIP/CCIP premiums (if owner-controlled or contractor-controlled program)
- Performance and payment bonds (1-3% of contract value)
- Umbrella/excess liability (project-specific)

**Professional Services:**
- Surveying and layout (or subcontracted)
- Third-party testing and inspection coordination
- As-built documentation
- Permit expediting

**Equipment (Non-Trade-Specific):**
- Crane (shared by multiple trades)
- Material hoist/elevator
- Scaffolding (shared)
- Concrete pump (if shared across multiple pours)
- Small tools and consumables
- Vehicles (superintendent truck, fuel, maintenance)

### Home Office Overhead Allocation

Home office overhead is allocated to projects based on a percentage of revenue. Common allocation methods:

**Revenue-Based Allocation:**
```
OH Rate = Annual Home Office Overhead / Annual Revenue
Example: $2,000,000 overhead / $40,000,000 revenue = 5.0%
```

**Labor-Based Allocation:**
```
OH Rate = Annual Home Office Overhead / Annual Direct Labor Cost
Example: $2,000,000 overhead / $15,000,000 labor = 13.3%
```

### Overhead Verification Checklist

When reviewing a contractor's or subcontractor's overhead charges:
- [ ] Is the overhead percentage within typical range for the project type?
- [ ] Are job overhead items actually present on site (trailer, toilets, dumpsters)?
- [ ] Is the superintendent full-time or shared with another project? (rate should reflect)
- [ ] Are insurance certificates current and covering this project?
- [ ] Is bond cost included only once (not in overhead AND as a line item)?
- [ ] Are temporary facilities appropriate for the project size?
- [ ] Is winter protection being charged only during winter months?
- [ ] Are clean-up costs reasonable for the scope of work?
- [ ] Is home office overhead separate from job overhead (not double-counted)?

## 5. PROFIT AND FEE

### Profit vs. Fee

**Profit**: The margin on direct work performed by the contractor. Profit is at risk -- if costs exceed the estimate, profit shrinks or disappears.

**Fee**: A management fee charged on top of costs, typically in CM/GC arrangements. Fee may be fixed (lump sum) or percentage-based. In guaranteed maximum price (GMP) contracts, the fee is typically fixed and the contractor shares in savings.

### Typical Ranges by Context

| Project/Contract Type | Typical Profit/Fee Range | Notes |
|----------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| Public hard bid | 3-6% | Tight competition, low margins |
| Private hard bid | 5-8% | More selective bidding |
| CM at-risk (GMP) | 3-5% fee + shared savings | Fee is more predictable |
| CM agency (no risk) | 2-4% fee | Fee only, no cost risk |
| Design-build | 8-15% | Higher risk, higher reward |
| Specialty contractor | 10-20% | Niche expertise premium |
| T&M work | 10-15% | Applied to labor, material, equipment |
| Subcontractor (to GC) | 8-15% | Sub's markup on their cost |

### Negotiation Factors

Factors that increase acceptable profit:
- Risk level (complex, uncertain, difficult conditions)
- Speed requirement (fast-track schedule demands premium)
- Technical difficulty (specialty expertise required)
- Market conditions (high demand, limited competition)
- Relationship/repeat business (premium for reliability)
- Geographic challenge (remote location, extreme climate)

Factors that decrease acceptable profit:
- Competitive market (many qualified bidders)
- Low risk (simple, repetitive, well-defined work)
- Long duration (steady income stream, lower risk per dollar)
- Owner relationship (ongoing program work, volume commitment)
- Visibility (high-profile project with marketing value)

### Bonding Impact on Profit

**Bonding costs reduce net profit:**
- Typical bond rate: 1-3% of contract value
- Bond cost is a real expense, often included in overhead but sometimes in profit
- A contractor with 5% profit and 2% bond cost has only 3% net margin
- Waiving bond (if allowed) can reduce price by 1-3% -- but removes protection

## 6. CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT

### Design Contingency by Phase

As design progresses, the estimate becomes more precise and contingency can be reduced:

| Design Phase | Estimate Accuracy | Recommended Contingency | Cumulative Accuracy |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Order of magnitude (concept) | -30% to +50% | 20-30% | Very rough |
| Schematic (30%) | -20% to +30% | 15-20% | Rough |
| Design development (60%) | -15% to +20% | 10-15% | Moderate |
| Construction documents (90%) | -10% to +15% | 5-10% | Good |
| Bid documents (100%) | -5% to +10% | 3-5% | High |
| After bidding (awarded) | -3% to +5% | 2-3% | Very high |

### Construction Contingency Factors

Construction contingency covers costs that cannot be anticipated during estimating:

**Common Contingency Uses:**
- Unforeseen subsurface conditions (rock, groundwater, contamination)
- Concealed conditions in renovation (hidden structure, asbestos, lead)
- Code interpretation differences between jurisdictions
- Coordination issues not identified during design
- Minor design errors/omissions that do not warrant a change order
- Weather impacts beyond normal expectations
- Material price volatility (for long-duration projects)

**What Contingency is NOT:**
- A slush fund for scope changes
- Extra profit margin
- A substitute for adequate estimating
- An authorization for unapproved work

### Contingency Drawdown Tracking

Track contingency as a running balance:

| Date | Description | Amount Drawn | Remaining Balance | % Remaining |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Start | Original contingency | -- | $250,000 | 100% |
| Month 2 | Unexpected rock excavation | ($35,000) | $215,000 | 86% |
| Month 4 | Additional soil testing | ($8,500) | $206,500 | 83% |
| Month 6 | Foundation redesign (RFI) | ($22,000) | $184,500 | 74% |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Target**: Contingency should be drawn down proportionally to project progress. If 50% of construction is complete and 80% of contingency is spent, there is a problem.

## 7. MARKUP STACKING

### How Markups Compound

When multiple layers of markup are applied, the final cost increases geometrically, not linearly. This is critical to understand when reviewing change order pricing.

**Simple Markup:**
```
Direct Cost:                  $10,000
+ Overhead (10%):              $1,000
+ Profit (10%):                $1,000
= Total:                     $12,000  (20% total markup)
```

**Compounding Markup (Markup on Markup):**
```
Direct Cost:                  $10,000
+ Overhead (10% of $10,000):   $1,000
Subtotal:                     $11,000
+ Profit (10% of $11,000):     $1,100   ← Profit is calculated on cost + overhead
= Total:                     $12,100  (21% effective markup)
```

**Multi-Tier Compounding (Sub + GC):**
```
Sub Direct Cost:              $10,000
+ Sub OH (10%):                $1,000
+ Sub Profit (10% of $11,000): $1,100
Sub Total:                    $12,100
+ GC Markup (10% of $12,100):  $1,210   ← GC markup on sub's marked-up price
= Owner Cost:                $13,310  (33.1% total markup on direct cost)
```

**Anti-Markup-on-Markup:**
```
Sub Direct Cost:              $10,000
+ Sub OH (10%):                $1,000
+ Sub Profit (10% of $11,000): $1,100
Sub Total:                    $12,100
+ GC Markup (10% of $10,000):  $1,000   ← GC markup on sub's DIRECT cost only
= Owner Cost:                $13,100  (31% total markup on direct cost)
```

### Common Contract Language

**"Markup shall be applied to the direct cost of the work only"** -- This means markup on the base cost, not on other markups. The most favorable language for the owner.

**"Markup shall not exceed X% of the total cost"** -- This caps the total markup regardless of how it is calculated. Example: "Total markup including overhead and profit shall not exceed 15%."

**"The GC's markup on subcontractor work shall be applied to the subcontractor's net cost"** -- This prevents the GC from marking up the sub's markup.

**"Tiered markup schedule"** -- Some contracts specify decreasing markup percentages as change order value increases. Example: 15% on first $50K, 10% on next $50K, 5% on amounts over $100K.

### Markup Verification Checklist

- [ ] What does the contract specify as allowable markup?
- [ ] Is overhead calculated on direct cost or on cost + other markups?
- [ ] Is profit calculated on direct cost or on cost + overhead?
- [ ] Is the GC marking up the sub's total or the sub's direct cost?
- [ ] Is there a cap on total markup percentage?

## 8. ESCALATION

### Understanding Price Escalation

On projects lasting more than 6-12 months, material and labor prices will change. Escalation accounts for these changes between the estimate date and the installation date.

### Common Escalation Indices

**Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Indices:**
- Producer Price Index (PPI) -- Construction Materials: tracks material cost changes
- Employment Cost Index (ECI): tracks labor cost changes
- Consumer Price Index (CPI): general inflation indicator

**Construction-Specific Indices:**
- Engineering News-Record (ENR) Construction Cost Index
- ENR Building Cost Index
- RS Means Historical Cost Index
- Turner Building Cost Index

### Escalation Calculation Method

**Simple Escalation:**
```
Escalated Cost = Base Cost x (1 + Annual Escalation Rate x Time in Years)

Example:
Base material cost (estimated today):    $500,000
Expected installation: 18 months from now
Annual escalation rate: 4%

Escalated Cost = $500,000 x (1 + 0.04 x 1.5) = $530,000
Escalation allowance: $30,000 (6% of base)
```

**Compound Escalation (More Accurate for Longer Periods):**
```
Escalated Cost = Base Cost x (1 + Annual Rate) ^ Years

Example:
Base cost: $500,000
Installation: 3 years from now
Annual rate: 4%

Escalated Cost = $500,000 x (1.04)^3 = $562,432
Escalation allowance: $62,432 (12.5% of base)
```

### Volatile Material Categories

Some materials experience more price volatility than others:

| Material | Volatility Level | Key Price Drivers |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Structural steel | High | Global demand, tariffs, scrap prices |
| Rebar | High | Steel market, trade policy |
| Copper pipe/wire | High | Commodity markets, global demand |
| Lumber | High | Housing starts, mill capacity, tariffs |
| Concrete | Low-Medium | Local supply, fuel costs |
| Drywall | Medium | Housing cycle, plant capacity |
| Roofing membrane | Medium | Petroleum prices |
| Insulation | Low-Medium | Energy prices, raw material costs |
| Aggregate | Low | Local supply, transportation |
| PVC pipe/fittings | Medium | Petroleum prices, resin supply |
| Aluminum | Medium-High | Commodity markets, energy costs |
| Glass/glazing | Medium | Energy costs, raw materials |

### Escalation Contract Provisions

**Fixed Price (No Escalation Clause):**
- Contractor bears all escalation risk
- Contractor should include escalation in their bid price
- Appropriate for short-duration projects (<12 months)

**Escalation Clause (Shared Risk):**
- Provides for price adjustment based on published index
- Typically applies to specific material categories (steel, copper, lumber)
- May have a threshold (e.g., no adjustment unless index changes >5%)
- May have a cap (e.g., maximum adjustment of 10%)

**Cost-Plus (Full Pass-Through):**
- Owner pays actual costs as incurred
- No escalation risk for contractor
- Appropriate for long-duration or uncertain-scope projects

### Superintendent's Role in Escalation

- Monitor material prices on long-duration projects
- Flag significant price increases to the project manager early
- Document market conditions (supplier quotes, price increase letters)
- Accelerate procurement of materials with rising prices when possible
- Maintain records of material purchase dates and prices for audit/dispute purposes
