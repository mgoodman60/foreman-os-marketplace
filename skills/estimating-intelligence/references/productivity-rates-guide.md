# Productivity Rates Guide
## Field Production Rates by Trade and Activity

---

## 1. HOW TO USE PRODUCTIVITY RATES

### Understanding Production Rate Tables

Production rates represent the expected output for a defined crew under **average conditions**: moderate weather (40-85F), experienced journeyman-level crews, adequate material supply staged within reasonable distance, standard access (ground level or single scaffold), and normal 8-hour work days. These rates are planning benchmarks -- actual field productivity will vary.

**Rate Format Used in This Guide:**
- Output per crew-day (8 productive hours)
- Crew composition identified for each activity
- Units specified (SF, LF, CY, EA, TON, etc.)

### Factors That Affect Productivity

Every construction activity is influenced by conditions that can increase or decrease the achievable production rate. Before applying any rate from this guide, evaluate these factors:

**Project-Specific Factors:**
- Building type and complexity (simple warehouse vs. hospital)
- Specification requirements (standard vs. high-performance)
- Quality level expected (commercial grade vs. institutional)
- Project size (economies of scale on larger projects)
- Repetitiveness of work (learning curve benefits)

**Site-Specific Factors:**
- Geographic location (urban congestion vs. open rural site)
- Elevation and terrain
- Soil conditions (for earthwork)
- Access restrictions (limited laydown, traffic management)
- Security requirements (badging, searches, escorts)

**Labor-Specific Factors:**
- Skill level of available workforce
- Union vs. open shop work rules
- Crew familiarity with the specific work type
- Supervision quality and planning effectiveness
- Morale and labor relations

**Environmental Factors:**
- Temperature extremes (hot or cold)
- Precipitation (rain, snow, ice)
- Wind (especially for crane operations and roofing)
- Humidity (affects concrete curing, paint drying, worker comfort)
- Daylight hours (seasonal variation)

### Adjustment Methodology

To adjust a base rate for field conditions:

1. Start with the base rate from the appropriate table
2. Identify all applicable adjustment factors from Section 14
3. Multiply the base rate by each adjustment factor
4. The result is the **adjusted rate** for planning purposes

**Example:**
- Base rate: Drywall hanging = 2,000 SF/day (2-person crew)
- Height adjustment (20-30 ft): x 0.88
- Overtime (50+ hrs/week): x 0.80
- Congested area: x 0.80
- Adjusted rate: 2,000 x 0.88 x 0.80 x 0.80 = **1,126 SF/day**

This adjusted rate is 56% of the base rate -- highlighting why field conditions matter enormously to project cost and schedule.

## 2. SITEWORK AND EARTHWORK

### Equipment Production Rates by Class and Material

**Excavation -- Hydraulic Excavator:**

| Excavator Class | Bucket Size | Production (BCY/hr) - Easy Digging | Production (BCY/hr) - Medium | Production (BCY/hr) - Hard |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Mini (3-8 ton) | 0.15-0.35 CY | 15-30 | 10-20 | 5-12 |
| Small (12-18 ton) | 0.50-0.75 CY | 40-70 | 30-50 | 15-30 |
| Medium (20-30 ton) | 0.75-1.25 CY | 60-100 | 45-75 | 25-50 |
| Large (35-50 ton) | 1.50-2.50 CY | 100-175 | 70-120 | 40-70 |
| Extra Large (50-80 ton) | 2.50-4.00 CY | 150-250 | 100-180 | 60-100 |

*Easy digging: sand, loose gravel, previously excavated material. Medium: common earth, clay, dense gravel. Hard: hardpan, shale, cemented gravel, frozen ground.*

**Grading -- Motor Grader:**

| Activity | Production per Hour | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Rough grading (first pass) | 4,000-8,000 SF | New subgrade, multiple passes |

| Ditch cutting | 400-800 LF | V-ditch, single pass |
| Road grading (gravel) | 1,000-2,000 LF | Two-lane road, both directions |
| Shoulder maintenance | 1,500-3,000 LF | Existing road shoulders |

**Compaction -- Vibratory Roller:**

| Material | Lift Thickness (Loose) | Passes Required | Production (CCY/hr) |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Sand/gravel | 8-12" | 3-5 | 100-200 |

| 6-8 ft | 36-48" | Excavator (medium) | 15-30 |
| 8-12 ft | 48-72" | Excavator (medium) | 10-20 |
| 12-16 ft | 72-96" | Excavator (large) | 5-15 |

*Rates assume no rock, no groundwater, open trench (no shoring installation time). Add 25-50% time for trench box installation and movement.*

**Hauling -- Off-Road Trucks:**

| Truck Size | Capacity (LCY) | Cycle Time Components |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| Articulated (25 ton) | 15-18 | Load: 3-5 min, Haul: variable, Dump: 1-2 min, Return: variable |
| Articulated (35 ton) | 20-24 | Load: 4-6 min, Haul: variable, Dump: 1-2 min, Return: variable |
| Rigid (40 ton) | 24-28 | Load: 5-7 min, Haul: variable, Dump: 1-2 min, Return: variable |

*Haul and return times depend on haul distance, road conditions, grade, and traffic. Calculate cycle time for each project.*
