# Construction Document Intelligence - Extraction Rules

**COMPREHENSIVE EXTRACTION SYSTEM FOR CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS**

This system captures deep, field-actionable intelligence from construction documents. Every data point should serve these purposes:
1. Enable auto-completion in daily reports and project management
2. Validate field installations against design
3. Track progress, productivity, and schedule performance
4. Flag required inspections, hold points, and quality requirements
5. Support procurement, coordination, and cost tracking
6. Enable analytics and predictive project intelligence

## Document Classification

### Pass 0: File Type Detection

Before any content analysis, check the file extension:

| Extension | Action | Reference |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| .dxf | **Direct DXF extraction** — run `parse_dxf.py` for exact spatial data (coordinates, blocks, hatches, dimensions). DXF data takes priority over PDF-estimated values. | [dxf-extraction.md](dxf-extraction.md) |
| .dwg | **Attempt conversion** — run `convert_dwg.py` which uses ODA File Converter to produce .dxf, then extracts. If ODA is not available, prompt user to request .dxf export from architect. | [dxf-extraction.md](dxf-extraction.md) |
| .ifc | **FUTURE** — IFC/BIM extraction not yet implemented. Document and note for future support. | [dxf-extraction.md](dxf-extraction.md) |
| .pdf | Continue to Pass 1 below for PDF-based extraction. | This file |
| .xlsx, .xls, .csv | Tabular data — likely schedule, sub list, RFI log, or submittal log. | [project-docs-deep-extraction.md](project-docs-deep-extraction.md) |
| .docx, .doc | Document — likely spec, contract, minutes, or report. | [specifications-deep-extraction.md](specifications-deep-extraction.md) or [project-docs-deep-extraction.md](project-docs-deep-extraction.md) |

## Extraction Principles

### Depth vs. Breadth

**When to Extract Deep:**
- Documents actively used in field (plans, specs, schedule)
- Data with specific measurable values (PSI, elevations, dimensions)
- Compliance requirements (hold points, testing frequencies)
- Coordination data (grid lines, room numbers, equipment marks)

**When to Extract Broad:**
- Reference documents (minutes, correspondence)
- Historical data (old RFIs, closed submittals)
- Descriptive content without actionable values

### Extract for Purpose

Every extraction should answer one of these questions:

**Daily Reporting:**
- "Formed and poured footings at Grids C-D, 3-4" → Need grid lines
- "Installed VCT in Room 107" → Need room schedule and finish schedule
- "Alexander Construction erected PEMB columns" → Need sub directory
- "Ambient temp 45°F (above 40°F threshold)" → Need weather thresholds

**Field Verification:**
- "Is this 4,000 PSI concrete correct?" → Need concrete specs
- "Are these #5 bars at 12\" o.c. right?" → Need rebar details
- "Does this panel location match the drawings?" → Need electrical panel schedule

**Progress Tracking:**
- "Completed Room 101-105 drywall (5 of 47 rooms)" → Need complete room count
- "PEMB dried-in milestone achieved (3 days ahead)" → Need milestone dates
- "SOG curing day 5 of 7" → Need curing duration requirement

**Procurement & Coordination:**
- "RTU-3 delivery delayed, impacts schedule" → Need equipment schedule with lead times
- "Awaiting door hardware submittal approval" → Need submittal log
- "Wells Concrete 12 CY delivered" → Need sub contact info

### Confidence Levels

Assign confidence to every extraction:

- **High**: Explicit and unambiguous (e.g., "4,000 PSI" in note)
- **Medium**: Inferred from context but reasonable (e.g., grid spacing calculated from dimensions)
- **Low**: Assumed based on typical practice (e.g., "likely 95% compaction" - not stated)
- **Vision Required**: Content needs image analysis (north arrow graphic, color-coded MEP)

**Flag low-confidence extractions** for user verification.

### Progressive Disclosure

Extract in layers:

1. **Always extract**: Core spatial framework (grids, floors, building areas)
2. **Extract when present**: Schedules, equipment lists, detailed specs
3. **Extract on demand**: Supporting details, historical data, reference info

### Cross-Referencing

Link extracted data across documents:

- Room 107 (floor plan) → VCT flooring (finish schedule) → Spec 09 65 00
- Grid C-3 footing (foundation plan) → 4,500 PSI concrete (structural notes) → Spec 03 30 00
- PEMB erection (schedule) → Alexander Construction (sub list) → SC-825021-06 (contract)

---

## Quality and Confidence

### Explicit vs. Inferred Data

**Prefer explicit** over inferred:
- Explicit: Grid line labeled "A" on drawing
- Inferred: Grid line position suggests "A" (flag as medium confidence)

### Coverage Tracking

For each document processed, track:

```json
{
  "populated": ["grid_lines", "floor_levels", "hold_points"],
  "empty": ["room_schedule", "MEP_equipment"],
  "needs_vision": ["compass_orientation", "color_coded_zones"],
  "low_confidence": ["compaction_density (assumed typical)"]
}
```

### Extraction Completeness

Target completeness varies by document type:

**Plans:**
- Grid lines: 100% (critical for spatial reference)
- Room schedule: 100% (all rooms for progress tracking)
- Door schedule: 100% (procurement and coordination)
- Finishes: 100% if present (room-by-room tracking)
- Structural notes: Extract all specific values (PSI, rebar sizes, embedments)
- MEP equipment: Extract all if schedules present

**Schedule:**
- Milestones: 100%
- Critical path: 100%
- All activities: Extract key data (ID, name, dates, duration, float)
- Sequencing: Extract for critical and near-critical activities

**Specifications:**
- Active sections: 100% (CSI divisions used on project)
- Deep-read priority sections: Division 01, 03, 05, 07, plus trade-specific
- Extract specific measurable values (not just "per spec")

---

## Integration with Project Management

Extracted intelligence feeds multiple systems:

### Daily Reports
- Auto-complete location references (grids, rooms, areas)
- Verify sub names and spell correctly
- Flag weather threshold conflicts
- Track milestone progress
- Reference spec sections and hold points

### Project Dashboards
- Phase completion percentages (rooms, floors, systems)
- Schedule health (critical path, float consumption)
- Procurement status (equipment delivery, submittal approval)
- Quality metrics (test results, inspection pass rates)

### Predictive Analytics
- Resource loading and site congestion prediction
- Weather impact forecasting (weather-sensitive activities)
- Procurement risk assessment (long-lead items)
- Cost variance trends

---

## Multi-Document Processing

When processing multiple documents at once:

1. **Classify all first** (Pass 1 + 2 for each)
2. **Present to user**: "I see structural drawings, a spec book, and a CPM schedule. Sound right?"
3. **Process in priority order** (earlier provides context for later):
   - Plans/drawings first (spatial framework)
   - Specs second (adds material/quality to spatial framework)
   - Schedule third (adds time dimension)
   - Contract fourth (adds constraints)
   - Sub list fifth (adds personnel)
   - Support docs last (RFIs, submittals, minutes)

## Extraction Workflow

For comprehensive extraction from a document set:

1. **File type detection** (Pass 0) — Route .dxf/.dwg to spatial pipeline, .pdf to text + visual
2. **Classify** all documents (Pass 1 + 2)
3. **Read specialized references** based on document types found
4. **Extract in priority order** (plans → specs → schedule → contract → support)
5. **Visual analysis** (Pass 4) — For plan sheet PDFs, convert to 300 DPI PNG and run `visual_plan_analyzer.py`
6. **Merge results** — Combine text extraction, visual analysis, and DXF data with source attribution
7. **Cross-reference** data across documents
8. **Validate** — Use Claude Vision to spot-check high-value extractions (room counts, equipment, symbols)
9. **Track coverage** (what was populated, what's missing, what needs vision)
10. **Flag low-confidence** items for user verification
11. **Structure output** for project-data storage
12. **Report results** with metrics and confidence levels

---

## Notes for Other Plugins

This extraction system is designed to be modular and reusable across different construction management plugins:

- **Daily Reports**: Focuses on field-actionable data for report generation
- **Project Management**: Emphasizes schedule, cost, and resource tracking
- **Quality Control**: Prioritizes specs, testing, and inspection requirements
- **Procurement**: Highlights equipment schedules, submittal status, long-lead items
- **Cost Management**: Extracts quantities, contract values, change order impacts

Each plugin can use the full extraction system or subset based on needs. The specialized reference files are organized by domain for easy selective use.
