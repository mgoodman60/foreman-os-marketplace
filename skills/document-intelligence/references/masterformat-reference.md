**Project:** Pre-Engineered Metal Building (PEMB) — Healthcare/Senior Care Facility
**Location:** Kentucky
**Document Purpose:** Field reference for construction daily reporting, QC inspections, and sequencing decisions

---

## Division 01 — General Requirements

### Typical Sequencing
- Mobilization, site setup, and project controls precede all other work
- Temporary facilities (office, storage) established first
- Site clearing and environmental controls ongoing throughout project
- Construction safety program, quality plan, and documentation system established before work starts
- Long-lead materials (PEMB frame, specialized equipment) ordered during preconstruction

### Common QC Issues
- Incomplete or inaccurate documentation of submittals and RFIs
- Shop drawing reviews delayed, creating downstream scheduling impacts
- Site safety protocol violations (hard hats, PPE not enforced consistently)
- Environmental controls inadequate (erosion/sediment, dust suppression)
- Temporary facilities inadequate for crew size or climate conditions
- Ineffective daily reporting leading to missed issues

### Standard Hold Points
- Mobilization complete, site accessible for material delivery
- Submittals approved before fabrication (structural, MEP, specialty items)
- PEMB frame shop drawings reviewed and stamped by architect/engineer
- Environmental permits obtained (stormwater, air quality if applicable)
- Insurance and bonding verified before crew begins work
- Site safety plan signed by all trades before mobilization

### Testing Requirements
- Environmental testing (soil, contamination) if remediation required
- Baseline surveys (existing conditions, reference measurements)
- No destructive testing typical for general requirements; focus on documentation and compliance testing

### Weather Sensitivities
- Site mobilization can occur in most weather (plan for muddy conditions in spring)
- Heavy rainfall can delay temporary facilities setup and site access
- Cold temperatures (<50°F) may affect material placement and concrete (if used)
- Wind events may delay crane operations or topple temporary structures

### Related Divisions
- **Div 03, 05:** Coordinate foundation/anchor bolt placement with PEMB erection schedule
- **Div 07:** Environmental controls tie to roofing/weather protection timeline
- **Div 21-28:** Schedule long-lead mechanical, electrical, plumbing with PEMB frame

### PEMB-Specific Notes
- PEMB frame procurement (12-16 week lead time) is critical path — must have approved shop drawings and orders placed early
- Coordination meetings with PEMB manufacturer essential (frame delivery sequencing, crane access, assembly requirements)
- Anchor bolt setting and verification critical before PEMB erection; rework costly
- PEMB erection schedule drives many other trades (rough-in MEP, interior framing)

---

## Division 02 — Existing Conditions

### Typical Sequencing
- Site investigation and assessment done during design/preconstruction phase
- Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) typically completed before construction start
- Utility locates required before site clearing or foundation excavation
- Hazardous materials survey (asbestos, lead, mold) if renovating existing structures

### Common QC Issues
- Utility lines encountered unexpectedly despite locates (locate misses, unmarked utilities)
- Existing contamination discovered during excavation (off-site disposal delay and cost)
- Underground structures (old foundations, utilities) interfering with new work
- Inadequate geotechnical data leading to foundation surprises
- Neighbor property damage claims from site work

### Standard Hold Points
- Utility locates completed and marked; utility companies notified before excavation
- Phase I ESA results reviewed; remediation plan in place if contamination identified
- Archaeological/cultural resource clearance if required by jurisdiction
- Boundary survey certified and staked on site

### Testing Requirements
- Phase I ESA with Phase II if Phase I identifies potential contamination
- Geotechnical boring and analysis (soil classification, bearing capacity, settlement analysis)
- Utility location records (as-built drawings from utility companies)
- Hazardous materials testing if renovation or demolition planned

### Weather Sensitivities
- Site investigation can proceed in most weather
- Heavy rainfall may require scheduling adjustments for boring or testing
- Winter may delay excavation or soil testing if ground is frozen

### Related Divisions
- **Div 03:** Geotechnical report directly informs foundation design and construction
- **Div 05, 13:** Anchor bolt layout depends on site survey and bearing analysis
- **Div 21-28:** Existing utility connections, locations, and capacities affect MEP design

### PEMB-Specific Notes
- For greenfield sites (Morehead One), phase II ESA unlikely unless site history indicates concern
- Anchor bolt pad locations must align with PEMB frame — survey errors compound during erection
- PEMB frame shipment windows depend on site readiness; delays in site prep block entire project

---

## Division 03 — Concrete

### Typical Sequencing
- Excavation and site prep complete, anchor bolt template from PEMB manufacturer available
- Footing/grade beam excavation and forming
- Anchor bolt setting (typically embedded in concrete with specific spacing/elevation requirements)
- Concrete placement (foundation pours often in multiple phases: footings, then grade beams)
- Cure time observed before loading (form removal, PEMB erection)
- Slab-on-grade (if parking, aprons) typically after exterior envelope complete (weather protection)

### Common QC Issues
- Anchor bolt misalignment (horizontal or vertical) — cannot be corrected easily once concrete cures
- Insufficient anchor bolt embedment depth or concrete strength
- Concrete cracks in foundation (especially in climate with temperature swings)
- Poor drainage around foundation leading to moisture intrusion
- Concrete strength verification delayed; erection proceeds before test results confirmed
- Rebar corrosion in anchor bolt areas from salt exposure (healthcare facilities may have de-icing near drives)

### Standard Hold Points
- PEMB frame shop drawing anchor bolt layout approved by PEMB engineer
- Anchor bolt template set and verified for horizontal and vertical positioning
- Concrete strength verified (cylinder tests at 7 and 28 days minimum) before PEMB erection
- Foundation drainage system inspected and functional before backfill
- Inspection of embedded items (electrical sleeves, anchors) before concrete placement

### Testing Requirements
- Concrete slump test at placement (document for each pour)
- Compression test cylinders (minimum 2 per pour; test at 7 and 28 days)
- Concrete strength typically 3,000-4,000 psi for foundations; verify with design
- Rebar cover verification (concrete protective layer)
- If anchor bolts critical: ultrasonic testing or re-survey of embedment after cure

### Weather Sensitivities
- Concrete placement affected by temperature extremes (<50°F, >95°F may require additives or curing measures)
- Rainfall within 24 hours of pour can weaken concrete surface
- Freezing within 24-48 hours of placement can cause damage; protect with insulation or accelerators
- Wind and hot weather accelerate concrete drying; may cause cracking if uncontrolled
- Kentucky climate: spring rains, temperature swings common; plan curing strategy

### Related Divisions
- **Div 05:** Anchor bolts embed in concrete; coordinate spacing, elevation, material spec with PEMB frame
- **Div 07:** Foundation drainage, moisture control critical to PEMB building integrity
- **Div 09:** Concrete slabs visible in occupied spaces (healthcare); finish and cleanability important
- **Div 33:** Site stormwater management may affect foundation drainage requirements

### PEMB-Specific Notes
- Anchor bolt placement is mission-critical: PEMB erection cannot proceed if bolts misaligned
- PEMB frame loads concentr ated at anchor points; concrete must be strong and accurately placed
- Anchor bolt templates (provided by PEMB manufacturer) must be set with laser/transit for accuracy
- Typical anchor bolts: 1" diameter, Grade 55, spaced 6-10 feet depending on frame design
- Post-pour, anchor bolt inspection (bolts should protrude 2-3" above concrete for column baseplate bolts)
- If anchor bolts are off-site welded anchors (less common for PEMB), ensure full embedment and no movement during concrete placement

---

## Division 04 — Masonry

### Typical Sequencing
- Masonry typically not primary construction for PEMB healthcare facilities (PEMB structure is steel frame + metal panels)
- If masonry used for interior fire-rated walls, partitions, or specialty features: placed after rough-in MEP in wall cavities
- Masonry may be used for exterior plinth/base (aesthetic, water barrier) before PEMB panel installation
- Interior masonry typically part of finishing phase after PEMB envelope closed

### Common QC Issues
- Mortar strength/consistency not maintained throughout project
- Brick/block alignment and plumb issues affecting wall interfaces
- Insufficient grout in cells (strength compromise)
- Water penetration through masonry into interior spaces
- Fire-rated masonry assemblies not installed to tested configuration
- Bond strength inadequate (poor workmanship, wrong mortar type)

### Standard Hold Points
- Masonry material samples approved (brick type, color, mortar mix design)
- Masonry fire-rating assemblies have tested and certified details available on site
- Below-grade masonry foundation backfill not placed until above-grade masonry waterproofing applied

### Testing Requirements
- Mortar compressive strength testing (minimum 2,000 psi typical)
- Bond strength testing (if high-durability requirements)
- Grout compressive strength (minimum 2,000 psi, often 3,000+ for structural masonry)
- Fire-rating verification (review test reports for rated assemblies)

### Weather Sensitivities
- Brick/block absorbs moisture; heavy rain can cause efflorescence or freeze-thaw damage in winter
- Cold weather (<50°F) affects mortar cure and brick bond
- Hot, dry weather accelerates mortar set; may require misting of units
- Temperature swings in Kentucky (freeze-thaw cycles) are hard on masonry; specify durable units and mortar

### Related Divisions
- **Div 03:** Masonry often bears on concrete footings; ensure adequate strength and timing
- **Div 05:** Where masonry meets PEMB frame connections, ensure compatibility
- **Div 07:** Masonry requires dampproofing/waterproofing (exterior) and vapor barriers (interior)

### PEMB-Specific Notes
- Masonry rarely structural in PEMB buildings (frame is steel); mainly for partitions, aesthetic bases, or specialized uses
- If interior masonry walls are fire-rated, ensure assembly matches tested configuration (PEMB frame + masonry + insulation must all align)
- Masonry plinth at PEMB foundation can enhance weather protection and finished appearance

- **Bolt torque verification** (sample testing with torque wrench; document final torque values)
- **Fireproofing thickness** measurement (cores or nondestructive testing)
- **Grab bar pull tests** (minimum 200 lbs load per healthcare codes; document pass/fail)

### Weather Sensitivities
- PEMB erection affected by high winds (>30 mph typically halts operations); Lightning risk during thunderstorms
- Cold weather (<32°F) may affect bolting (metal contracts; torque requirements change) and welding (brittle fracture risk if rapid cooling)
- Hot weather accelerates welding and fireproofing cure; may require cooling measures
- Wind and rain during PEMB erection increase safety risk; work stoppages common in Kentucky spring/fall weather
- Fireproofing application sensitive to temperature and humidity; cure time extends in cold weather

### Related Divisions

- **Div 07:** Thermal protection of steel frame (fireproofing, insulation) follows erection; affects interior finish planning
- **Div 09:** Interior finishes, paint, wall coverings applied after structural work and fireproofing
- **Div 21-28:** MEP rough-in often proceeds in parallel with secondary framing; coordinate penetrations and supports

### PEMB-Specific Notes
- **PEMB frame erection is critical path** — all other work dependent on frame completion and plumb verification
- **PEMB frame design** includes primary members (rafters, columns) and girts (wall members); all must be aligned for panel installation
- **Anchor bolts:** Typically 1" Grade 55, spaced 6-10 feet; must be set to PEMB manufacturer template within ±1/2" horizontal and ±1/4" vertical (varies by manufacturer)
- **PEMB erection sequence:** Usually columns first, then rafters; temporary bracing critical until all connections bolted
- **Bolted connections:** Standard PEMB connections use structural bolts (A325 or A490); torque per AISC specification
- **Welds in PEMB:** If field welds required (e.g., crane pads, equipment anchors), ensure WPS testing and CWI (Certified Welding Inspector) oversight
- **Fireproofing:** PEMB typically requires 1-3 hour fire rating; confirm required rating and spray application thickness per code

---

## Division 31 — Earthwork

### Typical Sequencing
- **Site clearing and grading** occurs during site preparation (early in project timeline)
- **Excavation for footings and foundations** follows site clearing; precedes foundation concrete placement
- **Backfill operations** occur after foundation concrete cures and structural work begins (typical 3-7 days after concrete placement)
- **Final grading and site work** occur near end of project (after all structural and above-ground work complete)

### Common QC Issues
- **Inadequate site preparation:** Debris, organic material not removed from bearing surfaces; affects foundation settlement
- **Erosion and sediment control failure:** Sediment wash off-site during rainfall; water quality impact; regulatory violation
- **Soil compaction inadequate:** Backfill not properly compacted; uneven settlement, cracking in structures above
- **Improper slope and drainage:** Water pooling at foundation; moisture infiltration risk
- **Unanticipated subsurface conditions:** Rock layer, existing utilities, buried debris encountered; scope/cost impact

### Standard Hold Points
- Site survey and geotechnical investigation completed; bearing soil identified
- Erosion and sediment control measures installed before site clearing
- Grading plan approved; elevations staked and verified
- Excavation completed to design elevations; substrate verified before foundation construction
- Backfill material inspected and approved before placement
- Compaction testing performed (standard proctor or modified proctor per geotechnical requirements)

### Testing Requirements
- **Soil compaction test:** Density testing of backfill material; minimum 95% of standard proctor density typical
- **Erosion/sediment control inspection:** Visual inspection of silt fences, sediment traps, site entrance controls
- **Grading verification:** Survey measurements to confirm elevations match design

### Weather Sensitivities
- **Earthwork highly sensitive to rainfall:** Muddy conditions slow work, cause access issues
- **Compaction difficult in wet conditions:** Moisture content of backfill material critical; too wet will not compact, too dry will not achieve density
- **Kentucky weather:** Spring thaw creates wet conditions; plan for extended drying time
- **Cold weather:** Frozen ground may prevent excavation; frost line (36-48" in Kentucky) affects footing depth

### Related Divisions
- **Div 02:** Existing conditions investigation
- **Div 03:** Foundation construction depends on earthwork completion and grade verification

### PEMB-Specific Notes
- PEMB projects may be greenfield sites; extensive earthwork required
- Site access for PEMB frame delivery (heavy equipment, oversized loads); temporary road/staging area preparation important

---

## Division 32 — Exterior Improvements

### Typical Sequencing
- **Site work and landscape** typically occurs near end of construction (after building envelope and utilities complete)
- **Parking areas and drives** often phased; initial staging areas may be used for construction, then converted to final design
- **Walks and site surfaces** installed late in schedule
- **Landscaping** installed just before or after occupancy

### Common QC Issues
- **Pavement quality issues:** Rutting, cracking, poor drainage due to inadequate base preparation or compaction
- **Slope and drainage problems:** Water pooling, surface erosion, inadequate drainage away from building
- **Accessibility non-compliance:** Parking spaces not reserved for persons with disabilities, ramps not ADA-compliant, walks not accessible
- **Pedestrian/vehicle safety issues:** Inadequate sightlines at intersections, pedestrian crossings not marked

### Standard Hold Points
- Grading and drainage plan approved
- Subbase and base course inspection before asphalt/concrete overlay
- Accessibility parking spaces and ramps inspected for ADA compliance
- Site drainage testing (water flow direction, drainage effectiveness)
- Final surface inspection (smoothness, no settlement)

### Testing Requirements
- **Compaction testing:** Base courses tested for density
- **Accessibility verification:** Parking space dimensions, slope, surface conditions checked per ADA
- **Pavement testing:** Asphalt thickness, concrete strength if cores are cut for verification

### Weather Sensitivities
- **Pavement placement sensitive to weather:** Asphalt requires warm, dry conditions (typically >50°F); concrete placement similar restrictions
- **Landscape planting sensitive to season:** Spring and fall preferred (better moisture retention, cooler temperatures); summer heat can stress new plants
- **Kentucky weather:** Spring rains can delay pavement work; fall provides good conditions for completion before winter

### Related Divisions
- **Div 31:** Earthwork and grading feed into site improvements
- **Div 33:** Utilities (water, sewer, storm drainage) may integrate with site improvements

### PEMB-Specific Notes
- Site improvements typically independent of PEMB structure; coordination mainly timing-related

### Healthcare / Senior Care Overlay
