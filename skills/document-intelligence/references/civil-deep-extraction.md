# Civil & Site - Deep Extraction Guide

Extract exact values for utilities, grading, and paving from civil/site drawings.

## Storm Drainage - Extract Pipe Data

For each pipe run:
- **Material**: RCP, HDPE, PVC, CMP
- **Diameter**: 12", 18", 24", 30"
- **Length**: Station to station
- **Slope**: % (e.g., "0.50%", "1.00%")
- **Invert IN**: Elevation at upstream structure
- **Invert OUT**: Elevation at downstream structure
- **Rim**: Manhole/inlet rim elevation

**Example**:
```
SD-1 to SD-2: 12" RCP, 50' long, 1.0% slope
  At SD-1: Inv OUT = 844.50', Rim = 856.20'
  At SD-2: Inv IN = 844.00', Rim = 855.80'
```

## Grading - Extract Spot Elevations

- **FFE**: Finished Floor Elevation (e.g., "856.50'")
- **Building corners**: Proposed grades
- **Entries**: Entrance elevations
- **Parking**: High/low points
- **Slopes**: %, direction of drainage

**Example**:
```
FFE = 856.50'
NW corner = 855.00' (proposed)
SE corner = 854.20' (proposed)
Main entry = 856.30'
Parking slope = 2% toward storm drains
```

## Paving Sections

**Asphalt**:
- Binder course thickness (e.g., "2.5\" binder")
- Surface course thickness (e.g., "1.5\" surface")
- Total asphalt thickness

**Aggregate Base**:
- Material (e.g., "#57 stone", "21-A")
- Thickness (e.g., "6\" compacted")
- Compaction (e.g., "98% modified proctor")

**Subgrade**:
- Compaction (e.g., "95% modified proctor")

**Example**:
```
Asphalt Pavement Section:
- 1.5" surface course (Type S5 mix)
- 2.5" binder course (Type I-2 mix)
- 6" aggregate base (#57 stone, 98% compaction)
- Subgrade (95% modified proctor)
Total thickness: 10" (4" asphalt + 6" base)
```

## Sanitary Sewer System

**Pipe Materials & Selection**:
- **PVC SDR-35**: Most common for 4"–8" laterals and building sewers. Lightweight, corrosion-resistant, quick to install. Check for ASTM D3034 rating.
- **DIP (Ductile Iron Pipe)**: Larger mains (8"–24"+), high-pressure zones, corrosive soil conditions. Heavier but extremely durable.
- **HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene)**: Trenchless applications, areas with settling. Flexible, good for difficult access. Less common than PVC for gravity systems.

**Pipe Sizes by Use**:
- **4" lateral**: From cleanout/building to main line. Minimum for residential.
- **6" building sewer**: From building to property line or main. Standard residential size.
- **8"+ main**: Collector lines, trunk sewers. Size depends on flow calculations shown on plan.

**Slope Requirements** (critical for function):
- **4" pipe**: 1/4" per foot minimum (2.08% slope). Steeper is acceptable.
- **6" pipe and larger**: 1/8" per foot minimum (1.04% slope). Main lines often 0.5%–1.0%.
- **Note**: Insufficient slope causes solids backup; excessive slope (>5%) causes scouring. Always confirm slope on profile.

**Invert Elevations** (marked on plan and profile):
- **Invert IN**: Water surface elevation entering a structure (manhole, catch basin). Read from upstream pipe.
- **Invert OUT**: Water surface elevation leaving a structure. Read from downstream pipe.
- **Structure depth**: Rim elevation minus invert OUT = depth to flow line.
- **Example**: MH-3 Rim 852.50', Invert IN 844.75', Invert OUT 844.50' (0.25' drop through structure).

**Manhole Details**:
- **Rim elevation**: Top of casting, used for surface survey tie-in. Mark clearly during excavation.
- **Shelf**: Sloped benching inside manhole where pipes enter. Directs incoming flow toward outgoing pipe.
- **Channel**: Formed concrete chute at base from inlet to outlet pipe. Guides solids, prevents dead zones.
- **Drop manhole**: Used where incoming pipe is >2' higher than outgoing. Includes internal drop pipe or baffle to dissipate energy.
- **Diameter**: Typically 4' for access; check plans for special sizes (3' or 6' for high-flow lines).

**Cleanout Locations & Spacing**:
- **Maximum spacing**: 100'–150' apart (check local code; some jurisdictions specify 75'). Prevents blockage sections.
- **Installed at**: Changes in grade, alignment, pipe size, or elevation. Always before the main line.
- **Type**: Wye fittings with caps above grade, or plugged tees inside structures.
- **Access**: Marked on final survey; must be accessible for cleaning equipment (jetting, rodding).

**Service Connections**:
- **Tap location**: Marked on main line, typically 3 o'clock position for gravity flow. Confirm on profile/plan.
- **Saddle type**: Cast iron or PVC clamp saddle (4"–6" lateral) or direct tee in main line (if already exposed during construction).
- **Backfill**: Density critical around new taps. Use sand/gravel, compact in lifts. Do not pile backfill against fresh concrete.
- **Lateral slope**: Same rules as mains (1/4" per foot for 4", 1/8" for 6"+). Slope must run toward main.

**Grease Traps & Interceptors**:
- **Grease trap**: Small device (residential kitchen, single sink). Typically 20–40 gallons. Requires regular pumping (monthly–quarterly).
- **Grease interceptor**: Large tank (commercial kitchen, food service). 500+ gallons. Two-chamber design; inlet → grease rise zone → outlet. Allows solids and grease to separate.
- **Sizing**: Based on waste water volume and retention time. Plans show size, location, and cleanout access.
- **Piping**: Inlet from sinks/drains, outlet to sanitary main. Trap prevents sewer gases backing up into building.
- **Maintenance note**: Pumping schedule is critical; full traps back up into kitchen, causing code violations and stoppages.

**Lift Stations** (when gravity flow fails):
- **Why needed**: When property is below main line grade or topography doesn't allow downhill flow.
- **Components**: Wet well (sump), pump(s), discharge line, check valve, control panel.
- **Discharge**: Forces sewage uphill through dedicated force main (typically smaller diameter, higher pressure pipe).
- **Material**: Force main is usually DIP or PVC Schedule 40 (higher PSI rating than sanitary pipe). Slopes are not relevant; elevation change is what matters.
- **Power/controls**: Electrical, alarm system if pump fails. Critical for 24/7 operation.
- **On drawing**: Shown as "LS-1" with elevation of wet well invert, pump capacity (GPM), discharge size.

**Testing Before Acceptance**:
- **Mandrel test**: Rubber plug pulled through pipe to verify no obstructions, root intrusion, or collapsed sections. Required for gravity sewers.
- **Air test** (low-pressure or bleed-off test): 0.5 PSI sustained for 10 minutes with no visible bubbles. Detects cracks, loose joints. More common in regions with groundwater.
- **TV inspection (CCTV)**: High-definition camera pulled through line. Documents joint condition, offset, cracks, I&I sources. Usually required for larger mains or problem areas.
- **Acceptance**: All three may be required before final sign-off. Confirm with local authority having jurisdiction.

## Domestic Water System

**Pipe Materials & Selection**:
- **DIP (Ductile Iron Pipe)**: Standard for mains (2"–24"), very durable in most soils. Heavier but corrosion-resistant. Check mill certifications.
- **PVC C900 (High-Pressure PVC)**: Smaller services (3/4"–2"), lighter weight, fast installation. Suitable for lower-pressure zones. C900 = 200 PSI rated.
- **Copper**: Older systems, some commercial. Corrosive in acidic soils; tubing (soft copper) used for service lines.
- **HDPE**: Trenchless (boring, directional drilling), corrosive soil conditions. Growing in use; verify local acceptance and certification.

**Meter Location & Size**:
- **Meter sets**: Typically 3/4" or 1" diameter. Size determines available household flow rate.
- **Location**: Shown on plot plan, usually near property line or inside building vault/basement. Affects service line routing.
- **Pressure check**: Meter size and supply line size must match; undersized meter restricts flow and increases pressure drop.
- **Note**: Fire service often separate from domestic meter; check if dual service required.

**Backflow Preventer Type & Location**:
- **RPZ (Reduced Pressure Zone)**: More robust, required in many jurisdictions for medical facilities, commercial kitchens, irrigation. Larger footprint, annual testing required.
- **DCVA (Double Check Valve Assembly)**: Simpler, smaller, suitable for low-hazard connections. Less frequent testing (every 5 years in some codes).
- **Location**: Usually at property line or inside building near meter. Plan shows exact location.
- **Why required**: Prevents contamination from flowing back into public water system (cross-connection protection).

**Fire Service Connection**:
- **Separate tap**: Dedicated line from main to FDC (Fire Department Connection) on building exterior. Typically 2"–4" line.
- **PIV (Post Indicator Valve)**: Gate valve on fire line with visible handle, shows open/closed status. Located near building or at property line.
- **FDC location**: Marked on plan; must be accessible to fire truck (within 50' of street, clear of obstructions). Typically on frontage nearest hydrant or main supply.
- **Check valve in FDC**: Allows one-way flow from FD truck; prevents backflow into city main.

**Hydrant Locations & Spacing**:
- **Spacing**: Typically 300'–500' apart (check local fire code). Ensures adequate coverage for fire flow.
- **Location on drawing**: Marked as "FH" with elevation note. Plan shows distance from building, street, intersections.
- **Bury depth**: Below frost line. Outlet nozzles at standard height (~2.5' above grade).
- **Flow requirements**: Plan notes required GPM for fire protection. Depends on building size, hazard classification.

**Thrust Blocks & Restraints**:
- **Why needed**: Water pressure pushing through fittings (tees, elbows, bends) creates lateral force. Concrete thrust block resists this.
- **Sizing**: By pressure (PSI) and pipe diameter. Plan should show block dimensions or designer calculates based on pressure @ fitting.
- **Location**: At every change of direction in line. Blocks are cast concrete, often placed before backfill.
- **Common mistake**: Forgetting thrust blocks at tees leading to fire line; fitting can shift under pressure, breaking seals.

**Valve Locations - Isolation & Control**:
- **Gate valve**: Primary shutoff valves on main line and branches. Allow full bore flow. Typically at: main entry to property, branches to zones, fire line.
- **Butterfly valve**: Used on larger mains (6"+) due to lighter weight and smaller footprint. Not suitable for small lines.
- **Valve boxes**: Show location above-grade, marked "WV" or similar. Depth noted (for operation depth, e.g., 3' below surface).
- **Spacing**: Typically one main line valve per 200'–300'. More frequent in commercial/industrial properties.

**Depth of Bury**:
- **Below frost line**: Protects pipe from freezing. Varies by region (Minnesota ~4', Southern US ~1'–2'). Check local code.
- **Clearance**: Typically 3'–4' minimum under roadways, 2'–3' under landscaping.
- **Mark on drawing**: Profile sections show depth at key points (road crossing, building approach, etc.).

**Pressure Testing Requirements**:
- **Test pressure**: Typically 150 PSI for 2 hours (or as specified in construction documents). Confirms no leaks.
- **Method**: Isolate section with plugs/valves, pressurize with water from pump or tank, watch gauge for drop.
- **Acceptance**: Zero leakage allowed. Any weeping joint fails test and must be re-done.
- **Time**: Leaks often appear in first 15 minutes; longer duration confirms joints have set if recently installed.

**Chlorination & Bacteriological Testing Before Use**:
- **Chlorination**: Disinfects new pipe to kill any bacteria introduced during construction. Dosage ~50 mg/L. Pipe sits for 24+ hours.
- **Flush out**: After chlorination, flush at high velocity to remove chlorinated water and any debris. Continue until water runs clear.
- **Bacteriological samples**: Collected after flushing. Must pass coliform testing (zero CFU per 100 mL per health dept rules).
- **Documentation**: Chain of custody for samples; lab results filed with health dept before final system approval.

## Site Utilities Coordination

**Minimum Horizontal Separations**:
- **Water from sewer**: 10'–15' minimum depending on jurisdiction. Separation reduces risk of contamination if sewer breaks.
- **Water from gas**: 3'–5' minimum (check local gas utility rules). Gas is often on opposite side of street from water.
- **Electrical ductbank from sewer**: 5'–10' minimum. Distance reduces moisture/flooding risk to electrical system.
- **Telecom from other utilities**: Typically 3'–5' depending on code. Fiber cables prefer lower ground stresses.
- **Note**: These are MINIMUMS. Plan layout often provides more separation for ease of installation and maintenance.

**Minimum Vertical Clearances at Crossings**:
- **Water OVER sewer**: 18" minimum vertical clearance (measured from outside diameter of sewer to inside of water pipe). Water on top protects it if sewer ruptures.
- **Electrical/telecom under sewer**: 12"–18" clearance. Cables protected from sewer infiltration.
- **Concrete encasement or steel casing**: Where vertical clearance cannot be maintained. Casing protects both utilities; requires special handling during installation.
- **Profile drawing**: Shows elevation of each utility at crossing; verify clearances before excavation.

**Crossing Protection Requirements**:
- **Concrete encasement**: 6" of concrete surrounds pipe/cable. Protects from external loads, abrasion, corrosion. More expensive but permanent.
- **Steel casing**: Larger diameter steel pipe serves as protective sleeve around utility. Utility pulls through casing; annular space may be sealed with grout or left open for future cable pulling.
- **Procedure**: Install casing first (often via boring), then pull utility through. If utility in casing, it can be replaced without re-excavating.
- **Cost/effort**: Casing significantly increases utility line cost; only used where crossing unavoidable and clearance inadequate.

**Conflicts with Other Trades**:
- **Electrical ductbank**: Usually 4"–6" concrete-encased runs in trenches. Marked on electrical drawings, not always on civil plans.
- **Gas lines**: Marked separately on utility coordination plan. Cannot be directionally bored like water/sewer; must be laid open.
- **Telecom / fiber**: Often installed last; may occupy same trench as others if protective covering (PVC conduit, duct spacer) used.
- **Power cable**: Sometimes installed in same trench as water/sewer if adequate separation and protection provided.

**How to Identify Conflicts from Plan Overlays**:
- **Same elevation (depth)**: If water shown at 3' deep and sewer at 2.5' deep in same trench area, they cross or run parallel too close. Red flag.
- **Same horizontal corridor**: Multiple utilities in narrow street or lot. Review profile at multiple cross-sections to confirm clearances.
- **Overlapping bends**: If sewer elbow and water tee are within 10' horizontally, check vertical separation on profile.
- **Trench annotation**: Plans note "shared utility trench" or "common corridor." These require special detail showing protective spacing/covering.
- **Conflict matrix**: Comprehensive designs include a conflict resolution table showing each crossing/parallel run and how it's handled.

**Utility Easement Requirements**:
- **Sewer easement**: Typically 10'–15' wide, centered on sewer line. Landowner cannot build structures, plant large trees, or alter grading over easement.
- **Water easement**: Similar width. Allows city/utility access for maintenance, repairs.
- **Combined easement**: On some properties, sewer + water under one easement. Reduces easement count but requires coordination with utility locations.
- **Recorded on deed**: Easements are legal documents, filed with property records. Do not assume easement exists; check survey and deed.
- **Impact**: Easement restricts future improvements; site plan must respect easement lines to avoid conflicts.

**Existing Utility Locations** (Critical step):
- **Call 811 (or local "call before you dig")**: Mark all existing utilities (water, sewer, gas, electric, telecom, fiber) before any ground disturbance. Marks are valid ~30 days.
- **Document marks**: Spray paint or flags show location. Cross-check with plan; if discrepancy, investigate before digging.
- **Conflicts with design**: If marked utility is not shown on plan or is in wrong location, notify designer and utility owner immediately.
- **Deep utilities**: Some utilities may be deeper than surface marks indicate. Vacuum excavation or careful hand digging near marked locations.

## Utility Tie-In Points

**Connection to City Main**:
- **Tap location**: Marked on plan at street or main line location. Tap size shown (e.g., "2" tap," "4" tap").
- **Permit & tap fee**: City/utility typically controls main taps. Separate permit and inspection often required. Contractor must schedule with utility.
- **Tap procedure**: Main is live; utility crews perform tap under pressure (wet tap) or shut main down (dry tap). Coordination essential to avoid service interruptions to neighbors.
- **Service line from tap**: Size and routing shown on plan from tap to property or building meter.

**Connection to Existing Site Utilities During Phased Construction**:
- **Phased sites**: Early buildings connect to temporary mains; later phases tie in as work expands.
- **Coordination plan**: Shows which building uses which temporary line during phase 1, where future connections occur for phase 2.
- **Sized for ultimate demand**: Temporary lines often sized for full build-out to avoid re-piping later.
- **Flexibility**: Design allows new structures to branch off existing lines without disrupting operating systems.

**Bypass / Temporary Connections During Construction**:
- **Bypass required if**: Construction work interrupts existing utilities serving occupied buildings or concurrent work.
- **Temporary water line**: Hose, pump, or temporary PVC line supplies adjacent buildings during tie-in work. Must be clearly marked and protected from damage.
- **Temporary sewer**: Bypass line (sometimes hose) diverts flows around work zone to prevent backups. Risk of overflow if not sized adequately.
- **Duration**: Bypass is temporary (hours to days). Must be removed and final connection tested before permanent operation.
- **Pressure/flow**: Temporary lines often smaller diameter; verify they can handle required flow. High-pressure water lines may need booster pump.

**Shutdown Coordination Requirements**:
- **Notice**: Utilities being shut down require advance notice to building operators, tenants, fire department (if fire service affected).
- **Duration**: Minimize shutdown time. Plan work sequence to reduce flow disruption.
- **Valve isolation**: Use existing valves to isolate work zone. Confirm valve function before relying on it.
- **Emergency contact**: On-site supervisor and utility liaison communicate throughout work. If problem occurs, know who to contact immediately.
- **Backflow/siphoning risk**: After shutdown, check for reverse flow into work area before crew entry. Especially critical for sewer work.

**As-Built Documentation Requirements for Utility Connections**:
- **Measured elevations**: Rim elevations, invert in/out at each connection. Compare to design and note discrepancies.
- **Distances & bearings**: Horizontal location of main line tap, distance from property line or reference point.
- **Material & size confirmation**: Verify what was actually installed matches construction documents.
- **Test results**: Pressure tests, flow tests, bacteriological samples (water) filed and attached to as-builts.
- **Photos**: Show connection details, valve locations, cleanout positions before backfill.
- **Record drawing**: Marked-up plan showing all utilities as actually built. Filed with city, developer, and owner.
- **Survey**: Final survey ties utilities to property monuments and structures. Critical for future maintenance access.

**Data entry notes**:
- **Elevations**: Record to 0.01' (nearest inch). Use same datum as rest of site.
- **Slopes**: Gravity systems use slope %; forced systems (fire, gas, electrical) show "N/A" for slope.
- **Depth**: Measured from rim/surface to pipe/duct centerline or top of ductbank. Verify during excavation.
- **Testing**: Note pass/fail, date, inspector. Attach test reports to record documents.
- **Conflicts**: Cross-reference in "notes" column (e.g., "crosses sewer main, 18\" clearance confirmed").
- **Incomplete data**: If detail not shown on plan (e.g., material not specified), flag in notes ("Material TBD, confirm with utility") and follow up before construction.

## Field Verification Checklist

Before final grading and backfill, verify:
- [ ] All utility lines exposed, depths measured against elevations.
- [ ] Slopes confirmed for gravity systems (storm, sanitary, water lateral runs).
- [ ] Invert elevations match design; any variance noted and documented.
- [ ] Cleanouts and access points located and marked for final survey.
- [ ] Crossing clearances verified (horizontal and vertical).
- [ ] Test results received and filed (pressure, mandrel, TV inspection, bacteriological).
- [ ] As-built plan updated with measured locations, elevations, materials.
- [ ] All easements and utility markings (811 calls, paint marks) cleared or preserved.
- [ ] Utility companies signed off on their work; final inspection letters filed.
- [ ] Site utilities JSON updated and cross-checked against as-builts.
