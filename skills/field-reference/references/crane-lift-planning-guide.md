# Crane Lift Planning Guide
## Superintendent's Reference — Safe Rigging, Load Charts, and OSHA Compliance

---

## 1. LIFT DIRECTOR RESPONSIBILITIES

### Who Is the Lift Director
On most commercial construction projects, the superintendent serves as the Lift Director. OSHA 1926.1400-1442 (Cranes and Derricks in Construction) does not use the term "Lift Director" explicitly, but the standard places responsibility on the "controlling entity" — that is you.

### Core OSHA Responsibilities
- **Select a qualified operator** — Must be certified per OSHA 1926.1427 (NCCCO, CIC, or equivalent). Verify certification card matches crane type on site.
- **Ensure inspections are current** — Daily pre-shift by operator, monthly documented, annual comprehensive. Keep inspection records on-site in the crane binder.
- **Maintain load charts on-site** — Manufacturer's load chart must be in the cab at all times. If the chart is missing, the crane does not operate.
- **Designate a signal person** — Required any time the operator cannot see the load or load landing zone. Signal person must be qualified or certified per OSHA 1926.1419-1422.
- **Control access to the lift zone** — Barricade the swing radius and load path. No personnel under suspended loads, period.
- **Verify ground conditions** — Confirm outrigger pads, crane mats, or compacted ground can support crane reaction loads.
- **Authorize each lift** — You give the go/no-go. Weather, ground, equipment condition, rigging, personnel readiness — all your call.

### Documentation Duties
- **Lift log** — Date, crane ID, operator name, load description, weight, radius, percentage of rated capacity
- **Critical lift plans** — Written, reviewed, signed (see Section 2)
- **Inspection records** — Daily operator checklists, monthly/annual inspection reports
- **Incident reports** — Any near-miss, two-block event, load drop, or contact with power lines
- **Signal person designation** — Written record of who is assigned and their qualification

## 2. CRITICAL LIFT CRITERIA

### When a Lift Qualifies as Critical
A lift is "critical" when any ONE of the following conditions exists:

| Condition | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Load exceeds rated capacity percentage | >75% of crane's rated capacity at working radius |
| Lifting over occupied structures | Any building, trailer, or area with personnel |
| Lifting over personnel | Any person in load path or swing radius |
| Two-crane (tandem) lifts | Any lift requiring two or more cranes |
| Proximity to power lines | Crane or load within 20 feet of energized lines |
| Hoisting hazardous materials | Chemicals, fuel tanks, pressurized vessels |
| Lifting near excavations | Crane positioned within 1x excavation depth from edge |
| Engineered plan required | Any lift the engineer of record or crane manufacturer flags |
| Blind lifts | Operator cannot see load throughout entire lift sequence |
| Lifts requiring load rotation | Load must be turned/rotated during lift |

### Critical Lift = Written Lift Plan REQUIRED
- Plan must be prepared before the lift
- Reviewed with operator, rigger, signal person, and all affected personnel
- Signed by lift director (you), operator, and site safety manager
- Kept on-site for duration of project, minimum
- Any deviation from plan = STOP, re-plan, re-sign

### Non-Critical Lifts
Still require verbal planning, qualified rigging, and operator confirmation of capacity — but do not require a written lift plan unless your company policy says otherwise. Many GCs require written plans for all lifts >50% capacity. Know your company standard.

## 3. PRE-LIFT PLANNING CHECKLIST

### Load Weight Calculation
1. **Actual load weight** — From shipping documents, manufacturer specs, or calculations. NEVER guess. Common weights:
   - Structural steel beams: 10-300 PLF depending on size (check beam tables)
   - Precast panels: 150 PCF concrete x volume
   - Mechanical units (RTU): check nameplate weight or submittals
   - Formwork/shoring bundles: weigh on truck scale if uncertain
2. **Rigging weight** — Add weight of slings, shackles, spreader bars, tag lines. Typically 200-2,000 lbs depending on rigging configuration.
3. **Dynamic load factor** — Multiply total by 1.10 (calm conditions) to 1.25 (wind, long boom, fast swing). This accounts for swing, acceleration, and wind loading.
4. **Total lifted load** = (Actual Weight + Rigging Weight) x Dynamic Factor

### Operating Radius
- **Measured from center of rotation to hook** — NOT to boom tip, NOT to load edge
- Account for boom deflection under load (actual radius increases as load goes on hook)
- Check radius at pickup AND at set-down — if radius changes, capacity changes
- Use load chart for ACTUAL working radius, not planned radius

### Ground Conditions
- **Bearing capacity** — Outrigger loads can reach 50,000-150,000+ lbs per pad
- **Outrigger pads** — Minimum 3x the outrigger float diameter. Timber mats: 6x6 or 8x8 hardwood cribbing under steel plates.
- **Crane mats** — 8"x4'x20' oak/mixed hardwood for crawler cranes on soft ground
- **Soft soil indicators** — Recent rain, fill material, adjacent excavation, underground utilities, frost heave
- **Slope** — Maximum 1% grade for most mobile cranes (check manufacturer specs). Level the crane, do not rely on outriggers to compensate for slope.

### Weather Check
- **Wind speed** — Measure at boom tip height, not ground level. Wind speed increases with elevation.
- **Temperature** — Extreme cold affects hydraulics and steel brittleness. Check manufacturer cold-weather limits.
- **Visibility** — Fog, rain, snow reducing visibility below safe operating levels = shut down

### Pre-Lift Verification
- [ ] Load weight calculated and documented
- [ ] Operating radius confirmed at pickup and set-down
- [ ] Ground conditions verified for outrigger/crawler bearing
- [ ] Weather conditions within limits
- [ ] Swing clearance confirmed (360-degree check)
- [ ] Overhead hazards identified (power lines, structures, other cranes)
- [ ] Barricades and exclusion zone set up
- [ ] Communication plan established (radio channel, hand signals)
- [ ] All personnel briefed on lift sequence
- [ ] Operator confirms capacity on load chart for actual conditions

## 4. RIGGING HARDWARE

### Sling Types Comparison

| Sling Type | Capacity Range | Heat Tolerance | Best Use | Key Inspection Points |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------|----------------------|
| Wire rope | High | To 400degF | Heavy steel, rough loads, outdoor | Broken wires, kinking, bird-caging, crushing, corrosion |
| Synthetic web | Medium | No heat or chemicals | Finished materials, painted steel | Cuts, abrasion, UV degradation, acid/alkali damage |
| Chain (alloy) | Very high | To 1,000degF | Foundry, extreme environments | Stretch (>3% = remove), wear, twist, cracks at links |
| Synthetic round | High | No heat or chemicals | Pipe, vessels, high capacity-to-weight | Cover cuts, tag legibility, internal fiber damage |

### Hitch Types and Capacity Factors

| Hitch Type | Capacity Factor | When to Use |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Vertical (straight) | 100% of rated | Single-point vertical pick |
| Choker | 75% of rated | Wrap around load and choke back — reduces capacity 25% |
| Basket | 200% of rated | Both ends on hook, load cradled — doubles capacity IF angle >60deg |

**Basket hitch warning:** Capacity factor of 200% assumes perfectly vertical legs. As legs angle outward, capacity drops dramatically.

### Sling Angle Effects — CRITICAL

| Sling Angle (from horizontal) | Capacity Reduction Factor |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 90deg (vertical) | 1.000 (100%) |
| 60deg | 0.866 (87%) |
| 45deg | 0.707 (71%) |
| 30deg | 0.500 (50%) — MINIMUM ALLOWABLE |
| Below 30deg | NEVER RIG — sling will fail or slide off load |

**Rule of thumb:** Never rig below 45 degrees from horizontal. Below 45 degrees, lateral forces on the load increase dramatically and sling capacity drops below 71%. Below 30 degrees, the sling retains only 50% capacity and side-loading becomes dangerous.

### Shackles

| Type | Use | Key Rule |
|------|-----|----------|
| Screw-pin (round pin) | Temporary connections, frequent rigging changes | Pin must be fully seated and hand-tight. Do NOT use where pin could roll open. |
| Bolt-type (safety pin) | Permanent or semi-permanent connections, multi-leg rigging | Cotter pin or nut prevents pin from backing out. Use for critical lifts. |

- **Capacity** — Stamped on shackle body (WLL = Working Load Limit)
- **NEVER side-load a shackle** — Reduces capacity by 50% or more, can cause pin failure
- **NEVER use a bolt as a substitute for a shackle pin**

### Spreader Bars
- **When needed** — To prevent sling angles from crushing or bending the load, to maintain load balance on long/flexible loads, to increase headroom
- **Sizing** — Must be engineered for specific load. Rated capacity stamped or tagged on bar.
- **Inspection** — Check welds, end connections, straightness. Any bend = remove from service.
- **Certified** — Spreader bars require engineering certification and load testing documentation

### Common Wire Rope Sling Capacities (Single Leg, Vertical Hitch)

| Diameter | 6x19 Class (tons) | 6x37 Class (tons) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 3/8" | 1.1 | 1.0 |
| 1/2" | 2.0 | 1.8 |
| 5/8" | 3.1 | 2.8 |
| 3/4" | 4.4 | 4.0 |
| 7/8" | 5.9 | 5.4 |
| 1" | 7.7 | 7.0 |
| 1-1/4" | 11.9 | 10.9 |
| 1-1/2" | 17.1 | 15.6 |

**Note:** Capacities vary by manufacturer and construction. Always use the capacity listed on the sling tag. These are reference values only.

## 5. SIGNAL PERSON REQUIREMENTS

### When a Signal Person Is Required (OSHA 1926.1419)
- Operator cannot see the load at all times during the lift
- Operator cannot see the load landing zone
- Operator's view is obstructed by building, structure, or other equipment
- Load must travel over areas the operator cannot observe
- Any time the operator requests a signal person

### Qualified vs. Certified Signal Person
- **Qualified** — Evaluated by a "qualified evaluator" (employer-designated), demonstrated knowledge of standard hand signals, understands limitations, can identify hazards. Acceptable for most lifts.
- **Certified** — Third-party certification (NCCCO or equivalent). Required by some project specifications and some jurisdictions. Check contract requirements.

### Standard OSHA/ASME Hand Signals

| Signal | Hand/Arm Position |
|--------|-------------------|
| HOIST (raise load) | Forearm vertical, index finger pointing up, rotate hand in small circles |
| LOWER (lower load) | Arm extended, index finger pointing down, rotate hand in small circles |
| SWING | Arm extended, point in direction of swing |
| BOOM UP (raise boom) | Arm extended, thumb pointing up, fingers closed |
| BOOM DOWN (lower boom) | Arm extended, thumb pointing down, fingers closed |
| STOP | Arm extended, palm down, hold rigid — NO MOTION |
| EMERGENCY STOP | Both arms extended, palms down, wave arms back and forth |
| DOG EVERYTHING (pause all operations) | Clasp hands in front of body at waist height |
| TRAVEL/MOVE CRANE | Arm extended forward, hand open, make pushing motion in direction of travel |
| EXTEND BOOM (telescoping) | Both fists in front of body, thumbs pointing outward |
| RETRACT BOOM (telescoping) | Both fists in front of body, thumbs pointing inward |
| RAISE BOOM AND LOWER LOAD | Thumb up on one hand, index finger rotating downward on other hand simultaneously |

### Voice Signals via Radio
- Dedicated radio channel — no other traffic
- Signal person and operator confirm channel before lift
- Use standardized commands: "Boom up," "Load up," "Swing left," "Stop," "Emergency stop"
- Repeat-back required: operator repeats command before executing
- If radio fails during lift = STOP all crane motion, re-establish communication before proceeding

### Multiple Crane Operations
- ONE signal person controls BOTH cranes during tandem lifts
- Each operator must be able to see the signal person or receive signals via dedicated radio
- Signal person must have clear view of both cranes, rigging, and load
- Pre-lift meeting: establish signal sequence, who moves first, coordination commands

## 6. CRANE INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS

### Daily Pre-Shift Inspection (Operator Performs)
Performed before each shift. Operator completes checklist and signs.

1. **Walk-around visual** — Structural members, welds, pins, bolts for cracks or damage
2. **Fluid levels** — Engine oil, hydraulic oil, coolant, fuel
3. **Wire rope** — Broken wires, kinking, bird-caging, crushing, corrosion, proper spooling
4. **Hooks** — No more than 15% throat opening increase, no more than 10-degree twist, safety latch functional
5. **Brakes** — Swing brake, hoist brake, boom brake all functional
6. **Load moment indicator (LMI)** — Powered on, functional, properly calibrated (no error codes)
7. **Anti-two-block device** — Functional, weight/switch in place
8. **Boom stops** — In place and functional (lattice boom cranes)
9. **Outrigger operation** — Extend/retract, pins lock, pads secure (hydraulic cranes)
10. **Controls** — All functions respond correctly, no sticking or delayed response

### Monthly Documented Inspection
Performed by competent person. Written record kept on-site.

- **Structural components** — Boom sections, turntable, carrier frame for cracks, corrosion, deformation
- **Sheaves** — Groove wear, bearing play, guards in place
- **Hooks** — Measure throat opening (compare to manufacturer's original dimension; >15% = replace), check for twist (>10deg = replace), magnetic particle testing if suspected cracks
- **Wire rope** — Count broken wires per lay length (varies by rope construction; typical removal: 6 broken wires in one lay, or 3 in one strand). Check diameter reduction (>5% from nominal = investigate, >10% = remove)
- **Brakes and clutches** — Load-holding test, drift test
- **Safety devices** — LMI, anti-two-block, boom angle indicator, level indicator
- **Hydraulic system** — Leaks, hose condition, cylinder condition, oil condition

### Annual Comprehensive Inspection
- Per ASME B30.5 (mobile cranes) or B30.3 (tower cranes) or manufacturer's requirements
- Performed by qualified inspector (factory-trained, certified)
- Includes all monthly items plus structural NDT (non-destructive testing) as required
- Load test if specified by manufacturer or after major repair
- Written report with findings, recommendations, and certification
- **Documentation must be on-site and available for OSHA review**

### Wire Rope Removal Criteria (Quick Reference)

| Condition | Removal Threshold |
|-----------|------------------|
| Broken wires (running rope) | 6 randomly broken in one lay length, OR 3 in one strand in one lay |
| Broken wires (standing rope) | 2 in one lay length |
| Diameter reduction | >5% from nominal (investigate), >10% (remove immediately) |
| Core protrusion | Any core showing through outer strands |
| Heat damage | Discoloration or distortion from heat source |
| Corrosion | Significant pitting, flaking, or loss of wire profile |
| Kinking, bird-caging, crushing | Any occurrence = remove from service |

---

## 7. WEATHER RESTRICTIONS

### Wind Speed Limits by Crane Type

| Crane Type | Typical Max Wind Speed | Notes |
|------------|----------------------|-------|
| Mobile hydraulic (telescopic boom) | 20-30 mph | Consult specific load chart derations. Short boom = more tolerant. |
| Tower crane (hammerhead) | 30-45 mph operating, 45+ mph = weathervane | Varies by manufacturer. Must be able to free-slew (weathervane) in high wind. |
| Tower crane (luffing jib) | 30-40 mph operating | Less wind-sensitive than hammerhead but still limited. |
| Lattice boom crawler | 15-25 mph at boom tip | Very wind-sensitive due to boom sail area. Long booms = lower limits. |
| Lattice boom truck crane | 15-25 mph at boom tip | Same sensitivity as crawler. Check charts for specific boom length. |

**Measure wind at boom tip elevation.** Ground-level wind can be 50-70% of wind speed at boom tip height. Use anemometer at working height when possible.

### Wind and Load Chart Derations
- Most manufacturers provide derated load charts for wind conditions
- If no wind chart provided, reduce capacity 2-3% per mph above 15 mph as a conservative field estimate
- Large-surface-area loads (panels, forms, sheets) act as sails — derate further or postpone lift
- Tag lines are NOT a substitute for proper wind limits — they help control rotation, not wind loading

### Lightning Policy
- **Suspend crane operations when lightning detected within 10 miles**
- Lightning detection: flash-to-bang method (5 seconds per mile — count seconds between flash and thunder, divide by 5)
- **30-minute clear rule** — Wait 30 minutes after last observed lightning or thunder before resuming operations
- Tower cranes: operator must descend immediately, crane set to weathervane mode
- All personnel clear of crane, outriggers, and wire rope

### Rain, Ice, and Extreme Conditions
- **Rain** — Reduced visibility, slippery surfaces (operator cab, load surfaces, rigging). Evaluate case-by-case.
- **Ice** — Ice on boom increases dead weight and wind loading, affects capacity. Ice on wire rope impairs inspection and operation. Clear ice before operating.
- **Extreme cold (<0degF)** — Steel becomes brittle, hydraulic response slows. Check manufacturer's minimum operating temperature.
- **Extreme heat (>100degF)** — Hydraulic overheating possible. Monitor fluid temperatures. Increased fatigue risk for operator and crew.

## 8. MULTI-CRANE LIFTS

### When Multi-Crane Lifts Are Required
- Load exceeds single crane capacity at the required radius
- Load geometry requires rotation during lift
- Access limitation prevents single crane from reaching both pickup and set points
- Load must be transferred from one crane to another (hand-off)

### Coordination Requirements
1. **Single signal person controls BOTH cranes** — Non-negotiable
2. **Identical lift plans** — Both operators receive identical written plans with their specific roles
3. **Matched lift speeds** — Cranes must lift, swing, and lower at coordinated speeds. One crane leads, one follows.
4. **Dedicated radio channel** — Signal person, both operators, riggers — no other traffic
5. **Pre-lift meeting mandatory** — Walk through entire lift sequence with all personnel

### Load Sharing Calculations
- **60/40 split minimum** — Never plan for equal (50/50) load sharing. Center of gravity is rarely centered, and dynamic loading will shift load unevenly.
- If CG is known, calculate actual load distribution: each crane carries load proportional to its distance from CG
- **Both cranes must have capacity for at least 75% of total load** as safety margin for dynamic shifting
- Have engineer verify load distribution calculations for critical tandem lifts

### Practice Lifts
- Recommended for all tandem lifts, required for critical tandem lifts
- Lift load 6-12 inches, hold, verify load distribution, check all rigging
- If anything looks wrong at 12 inches — set it back down and re-plan
- All personnel observe practice lift and confirm readiness before full lift

### Tandem Lift Procedure
1. Both cranes positioned and set up per lift plan
2. Pre-lift meeting completed, all personnel briefed
3. Rigging attached, verified, and confirmed by both riggers
4. Signal person confirms both operators ready
5. "Load up" — lead crane takes load first, follow crane takes load on signal
6. Lift 6-12 inches and hold (practice lift / load check)
7. Verify load sharing, rigging, crane stability
8. Proceed with lift sequence per plan
9. Set load — follow crane releases first, lead crane last
10. Rigging removed, lift complete, debriefed

## 9. POWER LINE SAFETY

### OSHA 1926.1408 Minimum Clearance Distances

| Voltage (kV) | Minimum Clearance |
|---------------|------------------|
| Up to 50 kV | 10 feet |
| 50-200 kV | 15 feet |
| 200-350 kV | 20 feet |
| 350-500 kV | 25 feet |
| 500-750 kV | 35 feet |
| 750-1,000 kV | 45 feet |

### Key Rules
- **Clearance applies to ALL parts of the crane** — Boom tip, load line, load, and any attachments
- **Clearance is measured from the nearest conductor** — Not from the pole or tower
- **Wind sway** — Conductors swing in wind. Add additional clearance in windy conditions.
- **Voltage may be unknown** — If you cannot confirm voltage, assume >350 kV and maintain 25 feet minimum until utility confirms actual voltage
- **De-energized lines** — NEVER assume a line is de-energized. Require written lockout/tagout confirmation from the utility company.

### When Closer Work Is Needed
1. **Option 1 (preferred): De-energize and ground** — Contact utility company, request de-energize, verify with lockout/tagout, and visible grounding before crane operates
2. **Option 2: Dedicated spotter** — OSHA 1926.1408 allows work closer than table distances with a dedicated spotter AND other precautions (insulating links, proximity alarms, etc.). Not recommended when de-energizing is feasible.
3. **Option 3: Insulated barriers** — Line covers, insulating blankets installed by utility company. Does NOT replace clearance requirements but provides additional protection.

### Electrocution Response
- If crane contacts power line: **STAY IN THE CAB** — the crane is energized
- Operator must NOT touch crane and ground simultaneously
- If fire forces evacuation: JUMP clear (do not step down), land with feet together, shuffle/hop away with feet together (step potential)
- All personnel stay away from crane, outriggers, and load line
- Call 911 and utility company immediately
- Do NOT attempt to move the crane off the line

### Pre-Work Planning for Power Line Proximity
- Identify all overhead lines within crane working radius + 50 feet
- Determine voltage (call utility company if unknown)
- Establish approach limit perimeter on ground — mark with cones, flagging, barriers
- Brief all personnel on power line locations and clearance requirements
- Consider non-conductive tag lines (polypropylene, not wire rope)
- Insulating links on load line if working within 20 feet (not a substitute for clearance)

## QUICK REFERENCE — SUPERINTENDENT'S DECISION TREE

**Before ANY lift, confirm:**
1. Is this a critical lift? (See Section 2 criteria) -- If YES, written lift plan required
2. What is the ACTUAL load weight? Never estimate. Get documentation.
3. What is the ACTUAL operating radius? Measure it.
4. Does the crane have capacity at that radius? Check the load chart, not memory.
5. Is the ground adequate? Outrigger/crawler loads verified against bearing capacity.
6. Are power lines within 50 feet? If yes, follow Section 9 procedures.
7. Is wind within limits? Measure at height, not ground level.
8. Is the signal person in place? If operator cannot see load/landing = signal person required.
9. Is the exclusion zone set up? Barricades, spotters, no personnel under load.
10. Has the operator confirmed readiness? Verbal confirmation before every lift.

**If ANY answer is unclear or unsatisfactory = DO NOT LIFT. Resolve first.**
