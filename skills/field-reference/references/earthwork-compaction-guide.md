## 1. COMPACTION STANDARDS BY LOCATION

### Foundation Subgrade
- **Standard specification:** 95-98% Modified Proctor (most common)
- **Critical note:** **Check geotechnical report for project-specific requirement** — some projects specify 95% Standard Proctor (weaker), others 98% Modified (stronger)
- **Tolerance:** Within ±2% of OMC (Optimum Moisture Content)
- **Verification:** Minimum 1 test per 1,000 CY; more frequent if soil variability high
- **Field procedure:**
  1. Remove unsuitable material (organics, oversize, debris)
  2. Scarify and remix existing subgrade material
  3. Compact with vibratory roller in thin lifts
  4. Proof roll before final approval
  5. Density test minimum 2 locations before building placement

### Slab-on-Grade Subgrade
- **Standard specification:** 95% Modified Proctor (typical)
- **Moisture tolerance:** ±2% of OMC
- **Testing frequency:** Minimum 1 test per 500-1,000 CY (depending on project size)
- **Additional requirement:** Proof roll with 25-ton loaded truck; observe for deflection >1"
- **Field procedure:**
  1. Prep subgrade (remove vegetation, level)
  2. Compact in lifts (standard 6-8" loose lift)
  3. Proof roll to verify uniformity
  4. Perform density tests
  5. Final grade ready for vapor barrier or fill placement

### Pavement Base Course / Subbase
- **Standard specification:** 95-98% Modified Proctor (depends on traffic classification)
- **Typical:** Highways and arterial streets = 98%; local streets = 95%
- **Moisture tolerance:** ±2% of OMC
- **Testing:** Minimum 1 test per 500 CY for base; 1 per 1,000 CY for subbase
- **Proof roll:** Required before pavement placement
- **Field procedure:**
  1. Spread material in uniform lifts
  2. Scarify and remix if moisture adjustment needed
  3. Compact with pneumatic or vibratory roller
  4. Proof roll for rut depth <1"
  5. Density test and approval before paving

### Structural Fill (General)
- **Standard specification:** 95% Modified Proctor
- **Moisture tolerance:** ±2% of OMC
- **Definition:** Compacted fill that supports structures or critical loads
- **Testing:** Minimum 1 test per 1,000 CY; increase if variable soils
- **Field procedure:**
  1. Quality control of incoming material (soil classification, debris removal)
  2. Uniform spreading and compaction
  3. Frequent density testing
  4. Document all test results

### Embankment / Non-Structural Fill
- **Standard specification:** 90% Standard Proctor or 90% Modified Proctor
- **Moisture tolerance:** ±3% of OMC (looser than structural fill)
- **Definition:** Compacted fill not supporting critical structures (landscaping, temporary fills)
- **Testing:** Minimum 1 test per 2,000-5,000 CY (less frequent than structural)
- **Field procedure:**
  1. Less stringent material control
  2. Standard compaction equipment (graders, dozers, light rollers)
  3. Infrequent density testing
  4. Observe for settlement; add material as needed

### Utility Trench Backfill
- **Location-dependent specification:**
  - **Under roads/pavements:** 95% Modified Proctor (critical — high traffic loads)
  - **Under sidewalks:** 95% Modified Proctor
  - **Landscaping/lawn areas:** 90% Modified or Standard Proctor
- **Moisture tolerance:** ±2% of OMC for 95% fill; ±3% for 90% fill
- **Tight working conditions:** 6" maximum loose lift (narrow trench limits equipment size)
- **Testing:** Minimum 1 test per 500 CY under pavement; 1 per 1,500 CY in landscaping
- **Field procedure:**
  1. Hand-compact in lifts around pipe/conduit to avoid damage
  2. Use jumping jack or plate compactor (heavy equipment may be unsafe near utilities)
  3. Work in thin lifts due to trench width
  4. Density test critical under pavement; less critical in landscaping

### Behind Retaining Walls
- **Standard specification:** 90-95% Modified Proctor (check wall design)
- **Moisture control:** Critical — excessive moisture creates hydrostatic pressure
- **Typical requirement:** Within ±2% of OMC, preferably on dry side of OMC
- **Material type:** Granular preferred (GW, GP, SW, SP); avoid fine-grained soils (ML, CL)
- **Testing:** Minimum 1 test per 500 CY; verify moisture at each test
- **Field procedure:**
  1. Use free-draining granular fill (no silts/clays)
  2. Install filter fabric between fill and wall
  3. Install drainage system (perforated pipe at toe or interior)
  4. Compact in lifts; monitor moisture to avoid over-saturation
  5. Ensure drainage system is operational before sealing

## 2. STANDARD vs MODIFIED PROCTOR

### Standard Proctor (ASTM D698)
**Test parameters:**
- Hammer weight: 5.5 lbs
- Drop height: 12 inches
- Number of layers: 3
- Blows per layer: 25 blows
- Mold diameter: 4 inches (standard)

**Result:**
- Lower maximum dry density than Modified Proctor
- Lower energy input = easier to achieve in field
- Historically used; still specified on some older projects

**Optimum moisture example (sandy soil):** OMC ≈ 12%, MDD ≈ 118 pcf

### Modified Proctor (ASTM D1557)
**Test parameters:**
- Hammer weight: 10 lbs (heavier)
- Drop height: 18 inches (higher)
- Number of layers: 5 (more layers)
- Blows per layer: 25 blows
- Mold diameter: 4 inches (standard)

**Result:**
- Higher maximum dry density than Standard Proctor
- Higher energy input = more difficult to achieve in field
- Current standard; required for most modern projects

**Optimum moisture example (sandy soil):** OMC ≈ 9%, MDD ≈ 128 pcf (same soil, same sample)

### CRITICAL DIFFERENCE: 95% Standard ≠ 95% Modified
**Example (same soil):**

| Proctor Type | MDD (pcf) | OMC (%) | 95% Compaction Target (pcf) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard | 118 | 12% | 112.1 |
| Modified | 128 | 9% | 121.6 |

**Meaning:** To achieve 95% Modified Proctor, the same soil must reach **121.6 pcf**, which is significantly higher than 95% Standard (**112.1 pcf**). Modified Proctor is much harder to achieve.

### Rule of Thumb
- Modified Proctor MDD is typically **5-10% higher** than Standard Proctor for the same soil
- In field, assume Modified Proctor is 8-10% harder to achieve
- **Always verify which test your specification references** — check geotechnical report and project specs before starting compaction

### Why Modified Proctor Now?
- Reflects equipment and methods available on modern projects
- Provides better bearing capacity and reduces settlement
- Standard Proctor increasingly replaced by Modified over past 20 years

## 3. MOISTURE CONTENT CONTROL

### Optimum Moisture Content (OMC)
**Definition:** The moisture level at which a soil achieves maximum dry density during compaction testing

**Laboratory determination:** From Standard or Modified Proctor test curve
- Moisture levels typically range 6-18% depending on soil type
- Sandy soils: OMC ≈ 8-12%
- Silty soils: OMC ≈ 12-16%
- Clay soils: OMC ≈ 14-20%

**Field application:** Adjust field moisture to match OMC so compaction equipment can achieve maximum density

### Typical Specification: ±2% of OMC
**Example (soil with OMC = 10%):**
- Acceptable range: 8% to 12% moisture
- Below 8%: Too dry, material won't compact, test results will be low
- Above 12%: Too wet, material pumps/slides under roller, poor results and difficult to work with

### Tighter Tolerance (±1%) for Critical Fills
**When used:** Foundation support fills, critical structural fills
**Reasoning:** Tighter moisture control improves consistency and reduces variability
**Difficulty:** Requires more frequent moisture adjustments and testing

### Field Signs: Material Too Dry
**Indicators:**
- Roller bounces; little compaction visible
- Material dust clouds during rolling
- Hammer / jumping jack rebounds; poor density results
- Clods don't break; soil remains chunky

**Correction:** Add water
- Distribute water with water truck (spray bar)
- Allow material to sit 15-30 minutes for moisture to distribute
- Remix with disc harrow or grader
- Re-compact and test

### Field Signs: Material Too Wet
**Indicators:**
- Roller sinks into material; surface waves form
- Material pumps (moves sideways away from roller)
- Moisture visible on surface (shiny appearance)
- Equipment leaves ruts >1" that don't firm up
- Density tests come back low despite heavy rolling

**Correction:** Aerate / dry material
- Scarify surface 4-6" deep with disc harrow or heavy grader
- Allow to air dry 1-3 days (weather-dependent)
- If time pressure: bring in additional material with lower moisture
- Re-compact after drying and test

### Field Squeeze Test (Quick Moisture Check)
**Procedure:**
1. Grab handful of compacted material from fresh lift
2. Squeeze firmly in closed hand
3. Open hand and observe

**Interpretation:**
- **Too dry:** Ball falls apart immediately; no moisture visible on hand
- **Near optimum:** Ball holds shape but crumbles easily; slight moisture on fingers
- **Too wet:** Ball holds tight shape; water squeezes out between fingers; shiny appearance

**Accuracy:** Not precise (±2-3% variation), but good field indicator to guide moisture adjustment

### Equipment for Moisture Adjustment
**Water application:**
- Water truck (typical 3,000-5,000 gallon capacity)
- Spray bar distributes water uniformly
- Multiple passes ensure even moisture distribution
- Cost: $50-150/day typical

**Aeration/drying:**
- Disc harrow (heavy farm equipment)
- Motor grader (blade cuts/spreads material)
- Allows air penetration and surface evaporation
- Cost: $75-200/day typical

## 4. LIFT THICKNESS

### Standard Loose Lift (Most Common)
- **Loose lift thickness:** 6-8 inches (typical maximum)
- **Compacted thickness:** ~4-6 inches (reduction factor varies by soil)
- **Equipment:** Vibratory roller (smooth drum, sheepsfoot, or compactor wheels)
- **Application:** General fill, subgrades, pavement base

**Procedure:**
1. Spread material to 6-8" loose thickness
2. Rake uniform
3. Compact until settlement rate <1" per pass
4. Layer is complete when additional rolling doesn't visibly compact further

### Thick Lifts (Heavy Equipment)
- **Loose lift thickness:** Up to 12 inches (with heavy equipment)
- **Equipment:** Large vibratory rollers (>15 tons), compactor trucks
- **Condition:** Requires adequate equipment and soil type that compacts easily (well-draining granular)
- **Risk:** Interior of lift may not compact fully; density tests may show low results in thick lifts
- **Recommendation:** Stick to 6-8" lifts unless equipment operator has proven thicker lifts work on that soil

### Hand-Operated Compactors (Tight Areas)
- **Loose lift thickness:** 4-6 inches (smaller equipment, more passes needed)
- **Equipment:** Jumping jack (pneumatic or gasoline), plate compactor (6"-18" width)
- **Application:** Confined spaces, behind walls, utility trenches, around structures
- **Procedure:** Compact each lift completely before next lift (many more passes than roller)
- **Time:** Slower process; allow additional schedule time

### Utility Trench Compaction
- **Loose lift thickness:** 6 inches maximum (tight working conditions)
- **Reasoning:** Trench width limits equipment; must hand-compact around pipe
- **Equipment:** Jumping jack or plate compactor
- **Procedure:**
  1. Place 6" loose lift
  2. Hand-compact around pipe/conduit (avoid damage)
  3. Complete compaction before next lift
  4. Density test in trench (accessible points)

### Rule of Thumb
**Thinner lifts = better compaction, especially with hand equipment**
- If density tests are failing, reduce lift thickness and increase number of lifts
- More time/cost but better quality results

---

## 5. PROOF ROLLING

### Purpose
**Objective:** Visual and physical verification that subgrade is uniform and adequately compacted
- Identifies soft spots or weak areas
- Confirms density testing results with visual observation
- Detects settlement or deflection under load
- NOT a replacement for density testing — complementary verification

### Equipment Requirement
**Minimum acceptable vehicles:**
- Loaded dump truck (minimum 25-ton gross weight)
- Pneumatic roller (loaded, minimum 10-ton static weight)
- Loaded scraper or grader (if weight adequate)

**Vehicle requirement:** Must have sufficient weight to stress the subgrade; light vehicles won't reveal soft areas

### Procedure
1. **Systematic pattern:** Drive in grid pattern covering entire prepared area
   - Drive spacing: ~3-5 feet apart (multiple parallel passes)
   - Cover all areas; don't skip areas
   - Turn smoothly to avoid excessive lateral stresses

2. **Visual observation during rolling:**
   - Watch for deflection (material yields under wheel load)
   - Look for rutting (permanent deformation >1" is failure)
   - Observe for pumping (water/fine material coming to surface — indicates moisture problem)
   - Note any areas that feel soft or spongy

3. **Post-rolling observation:**
   - After vehicle passes, observe if surface returns to level or remains depressed
   - Permanent rut >1" depth indicates failure — area needs rework
   - Deflection that rebounds is typically acceptable if <1"

### Acceptance Criteria
- **No visible deflection >1" under loaded wheel** (deflection measures in hundredths of inches; >1" is obviously visible)
- **No rutting >1" depth** after wheel passes
- **No pumping** or soft areas detected
- **Uniform behavior** across all areas (no isolated weak spots)

### When Proof Rolling Required
**Before slab-on-grade placement:**
- Critical verification before concrete pour
- Must occur within 48 hours of concrete placement (or surface may oxidize)
- Document with photos if soft areas found and corrected

**Before pavement base course placement:**
- Typical requirement on all projects with asphalt or concrete pavement
- Occurs after subgrade compaction complete
- Results documented in compaction report

**After subgrade preparation (general):**
- Foundation fill projects may require proof rolling
- Check with geotechnical engineer / project specs

### Common Issues and Corrections
| Issue | Indication | Correction |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Soft spot under wheel | Deflection, rut, or soft feel | Remove soft material, replace with compacted fill, re-proof roll |
| Pumping observed | Water/fines flowing from surface | Dry out subgrade, improve drainage, re-compact and proof roll |
| Localized rut >1" | Visible depression after wheel passes | Scarify, re-compact that area, proof roll again |
| Entire area soft | Consistent deflection across all areas | Subgrade is under-compacted; scarify, re-compact entire area, re-proof roll |

## 6. NUCLEAR DENSITY GAUGE (ASTM D6938)

### Device Types and Methods

#### Direct Transmission (Probe A) — Most Accurate
**Method:**
1. Drill small hole in surface with pin (depth = measurement depth, typically 6-12")
2. Insert probe through hole until seated at measurement depth
3. Radioactive source (Cs-137) at probe tip; detector above surface measures radiation transmission through soil
4. Density correlates to radiation attenuation

**Accuracy:** ±1-2% pcf typical

**Advantages:**
- Measures compacted material at specific depth
- More accurate than backscatter
- Better for thick, dense materials

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires drilling hole (visible markings on surface)
- Slower than backscatter
- Hole must be drilled for each test location

**Field application:** Foundation subgrades, pavement base — situations where accuracy is critical

#### Backscatter (Probe B) — Less Accurate
**Method:**
1. Place gauge directly on surface
2. Probe remains on surface; radioactive source and detector measure backscattered radiation
3. Radiation is reflected back from soil

**Accuracy:** ±2-3% pcf typical (less accurate than transmission)

**Advantages:**
- No drilling required
- Faster testing
- No surface markings

**Disadvantages:**
- Only measures top 6-8 inches (cannot measure deeper lifts accurately)
- Less accurate for precision applications
- Affected by surface moisture and roughness

**Field application:** Quick checks during rolling, rapid proof roll observations (not for final density acceptance)

### Standard Count — Calibration Required
**Before testing:** Gauge must be calibrated each day with standard count
- Gauge has radiation source of known intensity
- Standard block (aluminum or plastic of known density) is placed in field of view
- Meter reads counts per minute (CPM) or millivolts
- Establishes baseline for that day's testing
- Ensures equipment is functioning properly

**Procedure:**
1. Place standard block on firm surface
2. Position gauge per manufacturer instructions
3. Record standard count (e.g., 500 CPM)
4. Document on test sheet
5. If standard count is off >2% from previous readings, notify technician; device may need servicing

### Test Procedure — Direct Transmission
1. **Drill hole:** Use pin/auger to drill to measurement depth (typically 6" or 12")
2. **Clean hole:** Remove loose material from hole
3. **Seat gauge:** Insert probe into hole until gauge sits fully on surface
4. **Record reading:** Allow gauge to stabilize (per manufacturer, typically 30-60 seconds)
5. **Record:** Wet density (pcf), moisture content (%), dry density (pcf), % compaction

**Timing:** Test takes 2-3 minutes including drilling; gauge is reasonably fast

### Results Interpretation
**Output data:**
- **Wet density:** Total weight of soil + water per unit volume (pcf)
- **Moisture content:** Percentage of water in soil (%)
- **Dry density:** Weight of soil solids only, excluding water (pcf)
  - Formula: Dry Density = Wet Density / (1 + Moisture Content / 100)
- **% Compaction:** Dry density achieved ÷ Maximum dry density from Proctor test × 100%

**Example:**
- Proctor MDD = 125 pcf
- Field test: Wet density = 132 pcf, Moisture = 8%
- Dry density = 132 / 1.08 = 122.2 pcf
- % Compaction = 122.2 / 125 × 100% = 97.8% ✓ (PASS if spec is 95%)

### Radiation Safety — Licensed Operators Only
**Legal requirement:** Nuclear gauge operation requires radiation safety license

**Operators must:**
- Hold current license from state radiation authority (varies by state)
- Understand safe handling and storage of radioactive sources
- Know survey meter operation and personal dosimetry
- Follow transport regulations (DOT for moving between sites)

**On job site:**
- Source rod in safe position when not testing (typically stored in lead-lined container)
- Personal dosimeter worn during all testing
- Survey meter used to verify no leakage
- Training required before operation

**Cost:** Licensed technician typical cost $150-300/day for testing services

## 7. SOIL CLASSIFICATION QUICK REFERENCE (USCS)

### Unified Soil Classification System (USCS)
**Two letters indicate soil type:**
- First letter: Major group (G=Gravel, S=Sand, M=silt, C=Clay, O=Organic, Pt=Peat)
- Second letter: Gradation (W=Well-graded, P=Poorly-graded) OR plasticity (H=High, L=Low)

### Granular Soils (Gravel and Sand) — Better for Fill

#### GW — Gravel, Well-Graded
- **Description:** Gravel with good mix of sizes, little to no fines (silt/clay)
- **Compaction:** Excellent; easy to achieve high density
- **Drainage:** Excellent; free-draining
- **Fill suitability:** **Excellent** — preferred material for structural fill
- **Field behavior:** Locks together during compaction; achieves high density quickly
- **Common use:** Subgrade, pavement base, drainage fills

#### GP — Gravel, Poorly-Graded
- **Description:** Gravel with narrow size range, little to no fines
- **Compaction:** Good; some difficulty achieving density (uniform size can bridge under roller)
- **Drainage:** Excellent; free-draining
- **Fill suitability:** **Good** — acceptable for most fills
- **Field behavior:** May require more rolling passes; larger air voids than well-graded
- **Common use:** Subbase, embankment fill

#### SW — Sand, Well-Graded
- **Description:** Sand with good mix of sizes, little to no fines
- **Compaction:** Good to excellent; achieves moderate to high density
- **Drainage:** Excellent; free-draining
- **Fill suitability:** **Good** — commonly used structural fill
- **Field behavior:** Compacts well with vibration; achieves good density
- **Common use:** Structural fill, pavement base, drainage

#### SP — Sand, Poorly-Graded
- **Description:** Sand with narrow size range, little to no fines
- **Compaction:** Fair; difficult to achieve high density (uniform size won't compact tightly)
- **Drainage:** Excellent; free-draining
- **Fill suitability:** **Fair** — acceptable but requires more effort to achieve density targets
- **Field behavior:** May be loose even after compaction; add fines (silt/clay ≤5%) to improve
- **Common use:** Embankment, temporary fills (less common for structure support)

### Fine-Grained Soils (Silt and Clay) — More Difficult

#### SM — Silty Sand
- **Description:** Sand with silt component (10-20%), plasticity typically low
- **Compaction:** Fair; moderately difficult; moisture control critical
- **Drainage:** Moderate; some water held in silt particles
- **Fill suitability:** **Fair** — acceptable but requires moisture control
- **Field behavior:** Needs precise moisture (±2% OMC strict); too dry is difficult, too wet pumps
- **Common use:** General fill, non-critical structures
- **Warning:** More frost-susceptible than sand

#### SC — Clayey Sand
- **Description:** Sand with clay component (>10%), plasticity typically low-moderate
- **Compaction:** Fair to good; responds to compaction; moisture control important
- **Drainage:** Low; clay particles restrict water flow
- **Fill suitability:** **Fair** — acceptable for general fill; avoid under moisture-sensitive structures
- **Field behavior:** Clay content improves cohesion and density; moisture still critical
- **Common use:** General fill, temporary roads, embankment
- **Note:** Reduce permeability; may trap moisture in subsurface

#### ML — Silt, Low Plasticity
- **Description:** Silt with low clay plasticity (LL <50)
- **Compaction:** Poor; difficult to compact; moisture control very strict; pumps easily when wet
- **Drainage:** Poor; moisture retained; frost-susceptible
- **Fill suitability:** **Poor** — avoid for structural fill if alternative available
- **Field behavior:** Strict moisture window (maybe ±1% OMC); easily becomes too wet; very difficult to dry out
- **Common use:** Embankment fill when unavoidable; not recommended for structures
- **Problem:** Pumps under heavy loads; poor long-term performance
- **Frost concern:** High frost susceptibility; can heave in winter

#### CL — Clay, Low Plasticity
- **Description:** Clay with low plasticity (LL <50)
- **Compaction:** Good when moisture is correct; very poor when moisture off; moisture control critical
- **Drainage:** Very low; moisture trapped
- **Fill suitability:** **Fair** — acceptable if moisture carefully controlled; shrink-swell behavior
- **Field behavior:** Moisture window is narrow and strict; over-compaction or stiffness makes placement difficult
- **Common use:** General fill, embankment; less common for structures
- **Problem:** Shrinks when dry, swells when wet (volume changes); not suitable where movement must be minimized
- **Stability:** More stable than silt (higher cohesion) but less ideal than granular fill

#### MH — Silt, High Plasticity
- **Description:** Silt with high plasticity (LL ≥50); elastic, compressible
- **Compaction:** Very poor; difficult to compact; high compressibility
- **Drainage:** Very poor; retains water; very frost-susceptible
- **Fill suitability:** **POOR** — avoid for all structural fill
- **Field behavior:** Easily compresses under load; low bearing capacity; pumps readily; frost heave problem
- **Common use:** Not recommended for fills
- **Problem:** High settling potential; frost heave risk; difficult to work with

#### CH — Clay, High Plasticity
- **Description:** Clay with high plasticity (LL ≥50); expansive behavior
- **Compaction:** Very poor when moisture incorrect; good cohesion when dry but brittle
- **Drainage:** Very poor; moisture trapped; highly expansive when wet
- **Fill suitability:** **POOR** — avoid for all structural fill
- **Field behavior:** Highly sensitive to moisture; extreme shrink-swell; difficult to correct once compacted wrong
- **Common use:** Not recommended for fills
- **Problem:** Shrinks dramatically when dry (cracks), swells when wet; can damage structures; must be avoided under foundations

#### OL/OH — Organic Silt/Clay
- **Description:** Soil with organic matter (decomposed plant material, peat)
- **Compaction:** Poor to very poor; organic matter resists compaction
- **Stability:** Compressible; loses strength under load
- **Fill suitability:** **POOR** — should be removed and replaced
- **Field behavior:** Spongy, unstable; settles over time; weak bearing capacity
- **Common use:** Must be excavated and replaced with better material
- **Problem:** Long-term settlement and consolidation; unsuitable for any load-bearing application

#### PT — Peat
- **Description:** Peat moss, highly organic, fibrous material
- **Compaction:** Impossible; remains compressible and unstable
- **Drainage:** Highly variable; can retain water or drain rapidly
- **Fill suitability:** **NEVER use** — must be completely excavated and replaced
- **Field behavior:** Floats or remains spongy; cannot support structures
- **Common use:** Must be removed entirely
- **Problem:** Unsuitable for any purpose; will settle, compress, and fail under load

### Soil Selection Rule of Thumb
**Best to worst for structural fill:**
1. **GW, SW** — Excellent (granular, well-graded)
2. **GP, SP, SM** — Good to fair (granular to slightly silty)
3. **SC** — Fair (clayey sand; acceptable with moisture control)
4. **CL** — Fair (clay; acceptable with strict moisture control)
5. **ML, MH, CH, OL, OH, PT** — Poor to unusable (avoid; excavate and replace)

**Practical guidance:** If soil contains significant silt or clay (M, C), it will be difficult to work with. Granular soils (G, S) are always preferred. When poor soil is encountered on site, request material removal and replacement with better quality fill.

## 8. SWELL AND SHRINKAGE FACTORS

### Definition and Context
**Three measurement states of soil volume:**

1. **Bank (In-Place):** Soil as it exists in ground before excavation
2. **Loose (Excavated):** Soil after excavation; volume is larger (soil particles separated)
3. **Compacted (Installed):** Soil after compaction; volume varies depending on compaction effort and moisture

### Swell — Bank to Loose
**Definition:** Increase in volume when soil is excavated and loosened

**Typical ranges by soil type:**
- Sandy soils (GW, GP, SW, SP): 15-25% swell
- Silty soils (SM, ML): 20-30% swell
- Clay soils (CL, SC): 25-35% swell (clays swell more when broken up)

**Reason:** Excavation breaks soil structure; particles no longer tightly packed; air spaces increase

**Field example:**
- In-place (bank): 100 cubic yards at original density
- After excavation (loose): 120 cubic yards (20% swell)

**Impact on estimates:**
- If you need 100 CY of compacted fill, you must excavate ~120-130 CY of bank material (to account for swell and subsequent shrinkage)
- Always clarify measurement: are quantities in bank CY, loose CY, or compacted CY?

### Shrinkage — Loose to Compacted
**Definition:** Decrease in volume when soil is compacted

**Typical ranges by soil type:**
- Granular soils (GW, GP, SW, SP): 10-15% shrinkage
- Silty soils (SM, ML): 12-18% shrinkage
- Clay soils (CL, SC, CH): 15-25% shrinkage

**Reason:** Compaction removes air voids; particles rearrange into tighter packing

**Field example:**
- Loose (after excavation): 120 cubic yards
- After compaction to 95% Modified Proctor: ~105 cubic yards (12.5% shrinkage)

**Impact on estimates:**
- Loose soil volume decreases significantly during compaction
- Must account for this when calculating fill requirements

### Bank to Compacted — Net Factor
**Combined effect (Bank → Loose → Compacted):**

| Soil Type | Bank → Loose | Loose → Compacted | Bank → Compacted | Net Factor |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Sandy (GW/SW) | 1.20 swell | 0.88 shrinkage | 0.90 net | 0.90 |
| Silty (SM) | 1.25 swell | 0.87 shrinkage | 0.87 net | 0.87 |
| Clay (CL) | 1.30 swell | 0.82 shrinkage | 0.80 net | 0.80 |

**Interpretation:** 100 CY of bank soil = 90 CY of compacted sandy fill, 80 CY of compacted clay fill

### CRITICAL FOR ESTIMATING — Clarify Measurement Units
**Example problem:**
- Specification says "provide 1,000 CY of compacted structural fill"
- **Question: Is that 1,000 CY bank measure or 1,000 CY compacted measure?**

**Two scenarios:**

**Scenario 1 (bank measure):**
- Contract quantity: 1,000 CY bank measure
- After excavation/swell: 1,200 CY loose
- After compaction to 95%: ~1,060 CY compacted
- Cost: Lower (less material required)
- Contractor interpretation: Excavate 1,000 CY bank, compact whatever results

**Scenario 2 (compacted measure):**
- Contract quantity: 1,000 CY compacted measure
- Back-calculate: 1,000 CY ÷ 0.88 = 1,136 CY loose needed
- Back-calculate: 1,136 CY ÷ 1.25 = 909 CY bank measure
- Cost: Higher (need ~909 CY bank material)
- Contractor interpretation: Excavate enough to end up with 1,000 CY compacted

**Resolution:** Check contract specifications and clarify with owner/engineer before starting. Payment is typically on "compacted in place measure," but verification of what that means is essential.

### Swell and Shrinkage Table — Common Fill Materials

| Material | Bank-to-Loose | Loose-to-Compacted | Bank-to-Compacted Net |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|
| Sandy gravel (GW) | 1.20 | 0.88 | 0.90 |
| Sandy soil (SW) | 1.22 | 0.88 | 0.91 |
| Silty sand (SM) | 1.25 | 0.87 | 0.87 |
| Clayey sand (SC) | 1.27 | 0.85 | 0.84 |
| Sandy silt (ML) | 1.28 | 0.84 | 0.85 |
| Sandy clay (CL) | 1.30 | 0.82 | 0.80 |
| Clayey silt (MH) | 1.32 | 0.79 | 0.78 |
| Expansive clay (CH) | 1.35 | 0.76 | 0.77 |

**Use these factors to back-calculate bank quantities from required compacted quantities, or vice versa.**

## Key Reminders and Decision Framework

### Before Starting Compaction Work
1. **Obtain and read the geotechnical report** — Check required compaction %, test method (Standard vs Modified), moisture tolerance, acceptable soil types
2. **Clarify specifications** — Which compaction standard? Which Proctor test? Check project specs, not assumptions
3. **Soil testing** — If soil type is not from approved borrow, require lab testing to classify and run Proctor test
4. **Material source** — Verify borrow material meets soil classification and compaction requirements
5. **Climate/season** — Cold, wet weather makes moisture control difficult; plan extra drying time if needed

### During Compaction
1. **Lift thickness:** Start with 6-8" loose lift; reduce if density tests fail
2. **Moisture adjustment:** Dry out if too wet (disc harrow, wait for sun); add water if too dry (spray truck)
3. **Test frequency:** Minimum 1 test per 1,000 CY; increase if soil variable or tests failing
4. **Quality documentation:** Keep test reports, daily logs, photos; proves compliance if questions later

### Common Failure Scenarios and Fixes

| Problem | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Material too dry | Dust clouds; roller bounces; low density tests | Add water with truck; mix in; re-compact; re-test |
| Material too wet | Surface waves; pumping; low density tests | Scarify; aerate; allow drying 1-3 days; re-compact; re-test |
| Thick lifts | Low density in middle of lift | Reduce lift thickness to 6"; increase number of lifts |
| Weak subgrade discovered | Soft spots in proof roll; rutting | Excavate soft material; replace with compacted fill; re-proof roll |
| Poor soil type delivered | Silt/clay won't compact; failing tests | Request material replacement with better soil type (granular) |

### When to Call the Geotechnical Engineer
- Compaction tests consistently failing (3+ consecutive tests low)
- Soil type differs from borrow source tested
- Unexpected field conditions (excessive moisture, organics discovered)
- Proof rolling reveals widespread soft areas
- Moisture adjustment attempts not working
- Questions about specification interpretation

### Documentation That Matters
- **Daily compaction logs:** Date, location, material description, lifts completed, equipment used
- **Moisture and density tests:** Location, depth, wet density, moisture %, dry density, % compaction, pass/fail
- **Proof roll reports:** Date, vehicle used, observations, any corrective work
- **Photos:** Before/after conditions, soft areas, proof roll process
- **Material delivery tickets:** Borrow source, volume, date delivered

## Final Note
**Geotechnical report recommendations and project specifications always override these general guidelines.** This guide provides typical standards and field decision frameworks. Your project specifications, geotechnical report, and local building code requirements are the authoritative documents. When in doubt, contact the geotechnical engineer or project engineer for clarification.
