## 1. ASPHALT/HMA COURSE TYPES

### Pavement Structure (Top to Bottom)

| Course | Function | Typical Thickness | Aggregate Size | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| **Surface Course (Wearing)** | Ride quality, skid resistance, weather protection | 1.5-2" | 9.5mm or 12.5mm Superpave | Finest aggregate; densest mix; highest quality |
| **Binder (Intermediate) Course** | Structural, load distribution | 2-3" | 19.0mm or 25.0mm Superpave | Coarser aggregate; receives and distributes loads |
| **Base Course** | Structural support, load transfer to subbase | 3-4" | 25.0mm or 37.5mm Superpave | Coarsest aggregate; thickest lift; lowest in pavement |

**Rule of Thumb:** Minimum compacted lift thickness = **3x the nominal maximum aggregate size**
- 9.5mm mix: minimum 1.0" lift
- 12.5mm mix: minimum 1.5" lift
- 19.0mm mix: minimum 2.0" lift
- 25.0mm mix: minimum 2.5" lift

### Typical Section Examples

**Light-Duty Parking Lot (cars only):**
- 1.5" Surface (9.5mm)
- 2" Binder (19.0mm)
- 6-8" Aggregate Base
- Compacted subgrade

**Heavy-Duty Parking/Drive Lane (trucks, fire lanes):**
- 2" Surface (12.5mm)
- 3" Binder (19.0mm)
- 4" Base (25.0mm) — or combine with thicker binder
- 8-12" Aggregate Base
- Compacted subgrade

**Roadway (municipal, moderate traffic):**
- 2" Surface (12.5mm)
- 3" Binder (19.0mm)
- 3-4" Base (25.0mm)
- 8-12" Aggregate Base
- Compacted subgrade

## 2. ASPHALT TEMPERATURE REQUIREMENTS

### Temperature Limits by Stage

| Stage | Temperature Range | What Happens Outside Range |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Plant discharge** | 275-325°F | Below 275°F: poor workability, density problems; Above 325°F: oxidized binder, blue smoke |
| **At laydown (behind screed)** | 250-300°F | Below 250°F: mat tears, poor compaction; rolling starts too late |
| **Breakdown rolling** | 240-280°F | Below 240°F: roller marks, mat cracking; above 280°F: shoving |
| **Intermediate rolling** | 200-240°F | Compaction window closing; work quickly |
| **Finish rolling** | 160-200°F | Below 160°F: no further compaction achievable; marks won't roll out |
| **Cessation (no more compaction)** | Below 175°F (thick lift) / 185°F (thin lift) | Compaction effort after this point damages mat |

### Ambient Temperature Rules

| Condition | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Ambient above 50°F** | Normal paving operations |
| **Ambient 40-50°F** | Paving allowed for lifts >2"; use hot trucks, minimize haul distance, fast rolling |
| **Ambient below 40°F** | **Do NOT pave** — mat cools too fast, cannot achieve density |
| **Thin lifts (≤1.5")** | Minimum ambient 50°F — thin lifts lose heat extremely fast |
| **Wind >15 mph** | Increases cooling rate — treat as 10°F colder; accelerate compaction |
| **Rain** | **STOP paving** — water in mat causes stripping (loss of binder-aggregate bond) |
| **Wet base** | **Do NOT pave on wet aggregate base** — steam causes delamination |

### Haul Time and Distance

- **Maximum haul time:** 60-90 minutes from plant to laydown (shorter in cold/windy conditions)
- **Truck beds:** Tarped in cold weather and on long hauls to retain heat
- **Temperature check:** Infrared gun on each truckload at the paver; reject loads below 250°F
- **Material transfer vehicle (MTV):** Recommended for projects requiring uniform temperature and eliminating truck-to-paver segregation

## 3. ASPHALT COMPACTION

### Rolling Sequence

| Stage | Roller Type | Position | Key Rules |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Breakdown** | Vibratory steel drum (10-12 ton) | Immediately behind paver (within 3-5 minutes) | Most critical — achieves 70-80% of target density; operate in vibratory mode |
| **Intermediate** | Pneumatic tire (15-25 ton) | Behind breakdown roller | Kneading action seals surface, pushes aggregate together |
| **Finish** | Static steel drum (8-10 ton) | After intermediate | Removes roller marks; static mode only — no vibration |

**Compaction Window:** The time between laydown temperature and cessation temperature — typically **10-20 minutes** for 1.5" lift, **20-40 minutes** for 3" lift. This is the ONLY window to achieve density. Once the mat cools below cessation temperature, no amount of rolling will increase density.

### Density Requirements

- **Minimum: 92% of Theoretical Maximum Density (TMD)** — most DOT and commercial specifications
- **Target: 93-96% TMD** — optimal range
- **Maximum: 98% TMD** — over-compacted; risk of flushing (bleeding asphalt to surface)
- **Measurement:** Nuclear density gauge (real-time field verification) or cores (lab verification, final acceptance)
- **Number of passes:** Typically 3-5 passes breakdown, 2-3 passes intermediate, 2 passes finish — varies by mix and lift thickness

### Joint Construction

**Longitudinal Joints (parallel to paving direction):**
- **Hot joint (echelon paving — two pavers side by side):** Best quality; overlap 1-2" and roll joint immediately
- **Cold joint (previously placed mat):** Apply tack coat to cold edge; overlap new mat 1-1.5" over cold edge; knock back excess and roll
- **Joint density is the #1 quality concern** — joints fail before the mat; extra compaction attention at joints

**Transverse Joints (perpendicular, at start/stop):**
- **Butt joint:** Cut previous mat vertical and square; tack coat cut face; butt new mat against it
- **Notched wedge joint:** Feather new mat over old; less bump, but weaker joint
- **Infrared joint heater:** Heats end of previous mat before continuing — best quality joint

---

## 4. TACK COAT AND PRIME COAT

### Tack Coat

- **Purpose:** Bonds new asphalt lift to existing surface (between lifts, on milled surfaces, at vertical faces)
- **Material:** Emulsified asphalt (SS-1, SS-1h, CSS-1, CSS-1h) or PG-graded tack
- **Application rate:** 0.05-0.10 gallons per square yard (thin, uniform film)
- **Over-application:** Creates slip plane — layers delaminate under traffic
- **Allow to "break"** before paving — emulsion changes from brown to black (water evaporates, leaving residue)
- **Break time:** 15-60 minutes depending on temperature, humidity, and application rate
- **Apply to ALL surfaces that will contact new asphalt:** horizontal lifts, vertical curb faces, utility structures, concrete surfaces

### Prime Coat

- **Purpose:** Penetrates and seals aggregate base course before first asphalt lift
- **Material:** Cutback asphalt (MC-30, MC-70) or emulsified prime (AEP)
- **Application rate:** 0.20-0.50 gallons per square yard (heavier than tack — needs to penetrate)
- **Cure time:** 24-48 hours before paving (cutback must volatilize)
- **When required:** On granular aggregate bases before first asphalt lift — not always required on stabilized bases
- **Blotter material:** Apply sand to absorb excess if prime is tracking on tires

## 5. COMMON ASPHALT DEFECTS

### Identification and Causes

| Defect | Appearance | Cause | Prevention |
|--------|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Segregation** | Coarse, open-textured areas (dark spots = fine; light spots = coarse) | Poor truck loading, paver hopper wings not folded, end-dump trucks, long-distance material transfer | Use MTV, keep hopper full, fold wings frequently, avoid end-dumping into paver |
| **Fat spots (flushing)** | Shiny, black, sticky areas | Excess asphalt in mix, over-compaction, tack coat puddles | Verify mix design, control rolling passes, apply tack evenly |
| **Roller marks** | Visible drum/tire impressions in surface | Rolling too cold, too much vibration amplitude on thin lifts, finish rolling too aggressive | Roll at correct temperatures, reduce amplitude on thin lifts, lighter finish rolling |
| **Cold joints** | Visible line at longitudinal/transverse joints; joint cracks within 1-2 years | Poor joint construction, no tack coat on cold edge, cold mat at joint during compaction | Tack cold edge, overlap and knock back, compact joint first |
| **Raveling** | Surface aggregate loosens and falls out | Low density (under-compacted), paving in rain, late-season paving in cold | Achieve minimum 92% density, no paving in rain, observe temperature limits |
| **Rutting** | Depressions in wheel paths | Weak mix design, soft binder, over-compaction, insufficient pavement thickness | Verify mix design, control compaction, design for traffic loads |
| **Tearing** | Mat pulls apart behind screed | Mat too cold at screed, screed too high, dirty screed plate | Verify temperature, adjust screed, clean screed plate regularly |

## 6. CONCRETE FLATWORK

### Placement Procedures

1. **Subgrade verification:** Compacted to 95% minimum, proof-rolled, no soft spots
2. **Vapor barrier (if required):** 15 mil minimum, sealed laps, turned up at edges
3. **Forms:** Set to correct elevation (±1/8" for standard, ±1/16" for superflat), staked and braced
4. **Reinforcement:** Place per drawings — welded wire reinforcement (WWR), rebar mat, or fiber reinforcement
5. **Pre-placement check:** Forms clean and oiled, dowels/joint materials in place, rebar supported on chairs at correct elevation
6. **Concrete placement:** Deposit as close to final position as possible; do NOT drag concrete laterally more than 5 feet (causes segregation)
7. **Consolidation:** Vibrate with internal vibrator or vibrating screed — eliminate air pockets and ensure contact with forms/subgrade

### Finishing Sequence

| Step | Tool | Timing | Purpose |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| **1. Strike-off/Screed** | Straightedge (hand or vibrating) | Immediately after placement | Establish grade, remove excess concrete |
| **2. Bull float** | Magnesium or wood bull float | Immediately after screeding | Smooth surface, embed large aggregate, fill voids |
| **3. Wait for bleed water** | — | 15-60 min (varies by mix, temp, humidity) | **CRITICAL: Do NOT finish while bleed water is present** — traps water, causes scaling/delamination |
| **4. Edging** | Edging tool (3/8" or 1/2" radius) | After bleed water evaporates | Round slab edges to prevent chipping |
| **5. Jointing/Grooving** | Hand groover or early-entry saw | After bleed water; before final set | Cut contraction joints (see Section 7) |
| **6. Troweling** | Hand trowel or power trowel | After surface moisture gone, surface is firm | Densify surface, smooth finish; multiple passes for hard trowel |
| **7. Brooming** | Stiff-bristle broom | After final troweling | Create non-slip texture; broom perpendicular to traffic direction |
| **8. Curing** | Curing compound, wet burlap, or plastic | Immediately after finishing | Retain moisture for hydration — minimum 7 days |

### Critical Finishing Rules

- **Never add water to the surface to aid finishing** — weakens the surface, causes dusting, crazing, and scaling
- **Never finish while bleed water is present on the surface** — this is the most common cause of flatwork surface failure
- **Power troweling timing:** Surface must support the weight of the operator on kneeboards without leaving more than a 1/4" impression
- **Curing compound application rate:** Typically 200 SF per gallon; apply uniformly in two passes at right angles
- **Do NOT allow traffic on slabs** until concrete reaches minimum 75% of design strength (typically 7-14 days for 4,000 PSI concrete)

---

## 7. JOINT LAYOUT — CONCRETE FLATWORK

### Contraction Joints (Control Joints)

**Purpose:** Create a weakened plane where shrinkage cracking occurs in a straight, controlled line instead of randomly.

**Spacing Rules:**
- **Spacing = 2x to 3x the slab thickness in feet**
  - 4" slab: joints at 8-12 feet OC
  - 5" slab: joints at 10-15 feet OC
  - 6" slab: joints at 12-18 feet OC
  - 8" slab: joints at 16-24 feet OC
- **Maximum panel aspect ratio: 1.5:1** — no long narrow panels (e.g., 10' x 15' is acceptable; 10' x 20' is NOT)
- **Joints should intersect at right angles** — avoid acute angles in panel layout
- **Joints should align with columns, pilasters, and re-entrant corners**

**Joint Depth:**
- **Minimum 1/4 of slab thickness** (1" deep in 4" slab; 1.5" deep in 6" slab)
- **Early-entry saw:** Can cut within 4-8 hours of placement (before cracking begins); 1" deep minimum
- **Conventional wet saw:** Cut within 12-24 hours; full 1/4 depth
- **Timing is critical:** Cut too early = raveling at joint edges; cut too late = random cracking already started

### Isolation Joints

- **Location:** Around all fixed objects — columns, walls, manholes, catch basins, equipment pads, existing structures
- **Construction:** Full-depth separation (no reinforcement across joint); 1/2" premolded filler board (asphalt-impregnated or closed-cell foam)
- **Purpose:** Allow slab to move independently from fixed objects — prevents cracking at columns and walls

### Construction Joints

- **Location:** At end-of-pour (each day's work, or where placement stops)
- **Construction:** Keyed or doweled; bulkhead form at joint location
- **Dowels:** Smooth, round bars (not deformed rebar); typically 3/4" diameter x 18" long at 12" OC for 6" slab; one half greased/sleeved for movement
- **Key:** Formed key in joint face — transfers load without dowels (acceptable for lightly loaded slabs)

## 8. FLOOR FLATNESS AND LEVELNESS (FF/FL)

### Understanding FF and FL

| Metric | Measures | What It Means Practically |
|--------|----------|---------------------------|
| **FF (Floor Flatness)** | Local bumpiness — how flat is the floor surface within 12" and 24" spans | Higher FF = fewer bumps; important for forklift traffic, tile installation |
| **FL (Floor Levelness)** | Overall tilt — is the floor level over longer distances (10 feet+) | Higher FL = more level; important for equipment leveling, rack installation |

### Specification Categories

| Category | FF Value | FL Value | Typical Application |
|----------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Conventional** | FF 20 | FL 15 | Non-critical areas, mechanical rooms |
| **Standard** | FF 25 | FL 20 | Typical commercial, retail, office space |
| **Flat** | FF 35 | FL 25 | Warehouse, light industrial, tile floors |
| **Very Flat** | FF 45 | FL 35 | Distribution center, VNA (Very Narrow Aisle) warehouse approach |
| **Superflat** | FF 60 | FL 40 | VNA aisles with wire guidance, automated equipment, pharmaceutical |

### Achieving Flatness

- **FF 25 (standard):** Achievable with skilled hand finishing or highway straightedge
- **FF 35 (flat):** Requires laser screed or very experienced crew with straightedge checks
- **FF 45 (very flat):** Laser screed with experienced crew; tight mix design control; random traffic pattern on power trowel
- **FF 60+ (superflat):** Specialized placement — laser screed, narrow placement lanes, grinding/polishing post-placement; superflat contractor typically required

### Measurement

- **ASTM E1155** — standard test method using dipstick profiler or F-meter
- **Measure within 72 hours** of placement (before construction traffic damages surface)
- **Minimum 12 measurement lines** per section (per ASTM E1155 sampling requirements)
- **Report both minimum FF/FL and overall average** — specification may require minimum per section or per line

## 11. CURB AND GUTTER

### Common Types

| Type | Profile | Use |
|------|---------|-----|
| **Vertical curb (barrier/standard)** | 6" face height, 6" width | Roads, parking lots — prevents vehicles from leaving pavement |
| **Rolled (mountable) curb** | Sloped face, 4-6" height | Residential, low-speed areas — vehicles can mount over |
| **Valley gutter (V-gutter)** | No curb face; V-shaped gutter pan | Intersections, median crossings, drainage swales |

## 13. SEASONAL RESTRICTIONS

### Asphalt

| Condition | Restriction |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Ambient below 40°F** | No paving (mat cools too fast to compact) |
| **Base frozen** | No paving (frozen base will thaw and settle, cracking pavement) |
| **Wet surface** | No paving (steam delamination, stripping) |
| **Rain** | Stop paving immediately; resume when surface is dry |
| **End of season** | Most northern jurisdictions have paving season cutoff (October-November); check local standards |

### Concrete Flatwork

**Hot Weather (ACI 305):**
- **Above 90°F (or when evaporation rate exceeds 0.25 lb/SF/hr):** Implement hot weather measures
- **Actions:** Use retarder admixture, cold mixing water or ice, shade placement area, apply evaporation retarder to surface, begin curing immediately after finishing, place early morning or evening
- **Evaporation rate calculator:** Consider air temp, concrete temp, relative humidity, and wind speed — charts available in ACI 305

**Cold Weather (ACI 306):**
- **Below 40°F:** Protect concrete from freezing until it reaches 500 PSI minimum (typically 24-48 hours)
- **Below 25°F:** Heated enclosures required; maintain 50°F minimum around concrete
- **Actions:** Heat mixing water (not above 140°F if cement is added; 160°F if cement added after water), use accelerating admixtures, insulated blankets, heated enclosures
- **Minimum concrete placement temperature:** 55°F for thin sections (<12"), 50°F for moderate sections (12-36")
- **DO NOT use calcium chloride accelerator with reinforced concrete** — causes corrosion

## 15. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS

### Asphalt Paving Records

- **Daily paving log:** Station-to-station coverage, lift type/thickness, tonnage placed, temperature readings, weather conditions
- **Mix design (JMF):** Approved Job Mix Formula from lab; verify each delivery ticket matches JMF
