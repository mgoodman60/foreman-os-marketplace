## 1. SPRINKLER HEAD SPACING RULES (NFPA 13)

### Maximum Spacing Between Heads
- **Standard spray heads:** 15 feet maximum distance between any two heads
  - Measured center-to-center
  - Example: 15' x 15' grid = compliant; 16' x 15' = not compliant
- **Intermediate spacing:** 20 feet maximum (only for specific listed heads, rare)
- **No exceptions:** Tighter spacing required for special occupancies

### Minimum Spacing Between Heads
- **6 feet minimum** between adjacent heads
  - Prevents overlap creating dead zones
  - Some high-hazard systems: 5 feet minimum (designer specifies)
- **Why it matters:** Too close = extra heads cost money; too far = gaps in coverage

### Distance from Wall to Head
- **Maximum from wall:** 1/2 of allowable spacing
  - For 15-foot spacing: 7.5 feet max from wall
  - For 20-foot spacing: 10 feet max from wall
- **Minimum from wall:** 4 inches (allows some spray pattern)
  - Too close to wall = blocked spray pattern
- **Example grid:** 15' x 15' heads = heads 7.5' from walls, 15' apart in grid

### Distance Below Ceiling
- **Minimum:** 1 inch below ceiling
  - Prevents water hitting ceiling joist/deck
  - Allows water to fall through sprinkler opening
- **Maximum:** 12 inches below ceiling (for standard pendant/upright)
  - Beyond 12" = coverage pattern changes (wider at nozzle, less below)
  - Typical = 6 inches below for pendant heads in finished spaces
- **Sloped ceilings:** Head installation may require angling (see manufacturer listing)

### Special Head Placements

**Concealed / Recessed Heads:**
- Sit flush behind escutcheon plate (aesthetic for finished spaces)
- Max 1" recess into ceiling (manufacturer rated spacing still applies)
- Smaller spray pattern (opening restricts flow)
- Costs 2-3x standard head

**CPVC or PEX Drop Supply:**
- Some jurisdictions require CPVC/PEX drops into drywall cavities (flex + plastic)
- Reduces visible piping (aesthetic benefit)
- Complicates hydraulic calculations (smaller diameter = pressure loss)
- Maintenance: if joint fails inside wall, leak = drywall damage

### Coverage Per Head (Square Footage)

| Occupancy Hazard Class | SF per Head | Example Application |
|------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| Light Hazard | 200-225 SF | Offices, apartments, light manufacturing |
| Ordinary Hazard Group 1 | 130 SF | Retail, restaurants, auto repair |
| Ordinary Hazard Group 2 | 130 SF | Woodworking, appliance manufacturing |
| Extra Hazard | 90-100 SF | Flammable liquid storage, heavy manufacturing |

**Calculation example:**
- Room 30' x 40' = 1200 SF
- Light hazard (200 SF/head) = 1200 ÷ 200 = 6 heads minimum
- Grid layout: 2 rows x 3 heads = 15' spacing works perfectly

### Common Spacing Violations

**Error #1: Heads too far apart**
- Attempted to reduce cost (fewer heads)
- Result: gaps in coverage, partial suppression
- Fix: add heads to meet spacing + coverage requirements

**Error #2: Heads mounted on duct/structure**
- Attempted to bypass ceiling height issues
- Result: spray pattern blocked, uneven coverage
- Fix: relocate duct; install head properly below ceiling

**Error #3: Obstruction not recognized**
- Truss, beam, cable tray blocks spray pattern
- Result: area below obstruction unprotected
- Fix: add secondary head or reposition primary

**Error #4: Escutcheon too tight**
- Decorative ring compressed to ceiling
- Result: water runs down wall instead of spraying outward
- Fix: loosen escutcheon; verify 1-inch clearance minimum

---

## 2. SPRINKLER HEAD TYPES & TEMPERATURE RATINGS

### Head Type Selection by Location

**Pendant (Most Common in Occupied Spaces)**
- Hangs below ceiling
- Spray pattern: 360° horizontal, inverted cone downward
- Best for: finished ceilings (offices, retail, apartments)
- Aesthetics: can accept recessed escutcheon
- Limitation: needs 6-12 inches below ceiling (not for tight cavities)

**Upright (Warehouses, Mechanical Rooms)**
- Mounted on top of pipe, extends upward
- Spray pattern: hits ceiling first, deflects downward
- Best for: unfinished spaces (high ceilings, industrial)
- Advantage: can mount high (20+ feet) if needed
- Disadvantage: water contacts structure, potential corrosion

**Sidewall (Corridors, Small Rooms)**
- Mounted on wall, sprays horizontally
- Spray pattern: semicircle, hits wall then drops
- Best for: long narrow corridors, perimeter walls, small rooms
- Advantage: one head covers wider area from wall
- Limitation: only 2-3 heads per wall section (pattern overlaps)
- Coverage: typically 200 SF for sidewall (less than pendant)

**Concealed (Aesthetic Requirements)**
- Behind ceiling escutcheon, opens when temperature reached
- Spray pattern: smaller than standard (opening limited)
- Best for: high-end retail, healthcare, fine dining
- Cost: 2-3x standard head
- Limitation: fewer heads per area (larger spacing required)
- Complexity: harder to inspect/maintain (hidden inside ceiling)

### Temperature Ratings & Color Codes

| Rating | Temp Range | Color | Usage |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Ordinary | 135-170°F | Uncolored/Black | Standard; most buildings |
| Intermediate | 175-225°F | White | Kitchens, mechanical rooms, near HVAC |
| High | 250-300°F | Blue | High-temperature industrial, near ovens |
| Extra High | 286-360°F | Red | Foundries, furnaces, extreme heat areas |

**Selection rule:**
- Use ordinary rating for standard occupied spaces
- Use intermediate for kitchens + mechanical rooms (heat sources below)
- Use high rating ONLY if specified by designer (thermal engineer typically determines)
- Color coding ensures correct head installed in correct location (inspection point)

**Common temperature error:**
- Installing ordinary head in kitchen = premature actuation (false alarms) OR slow actuation (if heat deflected away)
- Solution: install intermediate-rated head in kitchen (higher threshold), standard everywhere else

## 3. FIRE-RATED ASSEMBLY REQUIREMENTS

### What Makes an Assembly "Fire-Rated"

**Rating definition:** Assembly withstands fire for specified time while:
1. **Preventing flame passage** (F-rating)
2. **Limiting temperature rise** on unexposed side (T-rating)
3. **Maintaining structural integrity** (load-bearing assemblies)

### 1-Hour Fire Rating Assemblies

**Wall Assembly (UL U305 Standard):**
- Single layer 5/8" Type X gypsum drywall (each side of studs)
- 16-gauge steel studs, 16" on center
- Basecoat joint compound; taped/mudded
- Result: 1-hour rating on both sides
- Cost: ~$5-8 per SF material + labor

**Alternative (UL U411):**
- Single layer 5/8" Type X gypsum (each side)
- Wood studs with plaster + lath (older construction method)
- Similar 1-hour rating

**Floor/Ceiling (UL F0502):**
- 4" concrete slab + 5/8" gypsum board ceiling
- Fire-rated assembly rating: 1 hour
- Allows air return through plenum without rated ductwork

### 2-Hour Fire Rating Assemblies

**Wall Assembly (UL U301 Standard):**
- **Double layer** 5/8" Type X gypsum (each side of studs)
- 16-gauge steel studs, 16" on center
- First layer: basecoat compound, then second layer
- Second layer: basecoat + finish mud, tape all joints
- Staggered fasteners (no fastener in same location on both layers)
- Result: 2-hour rating both sides
- Cost: ~$12-15 per SF (double layer = higher cost)

**Wall Assembly (U412 Alternative):**
- Double layer 5/8" Type X + staggered studs
- Each layer different stud spacing (reduces sound transmission too)
- Still 2-hour rating with additional acoustic benefit

**Floor/Ceiling (UL F0504):**
- 6" concrete slab (thick slab = thermal mass)
- 5/8" Type X gypsum board ceiling
- Fire rating: 2 hours
- Common in multi-story office buildings

### 3-Hour Fire Rating Assemblies

**Wall Assembly:**
- Rarely Type X drywall (insufficient)
- Typically CMU (concrete masonry unit) construction
  - 8" grouted CMU with steel reinforcing
  - Single wythe (one thickness)
- Alternative: brick masonry + Type X gypsum
- Cost: ~$20-25 per SF (masonry premium)

**Why CMU needed?** Drywall has organic paper facing (burns after certain time). Masonry is inorganic (doesn't burn).

### Shaft Walls (Elevator, Mechanical, Stairwell Shafts)

**Required rating per IBC:**
- Minimum 1-hour rating (most occupancy types)
- 2-hour rating (some building types: high-rise, healthcare)

**Assembly selection:**
- 1-hour: Single layer 5/8" Type X on both sides (same as wall)
- 2-hour: Double layer 5/8" Type X on both sides

**Access doors in shaft wall:**
- Must be fire-rated door (20-minute minimum for 1-hour wall, 1.5-hour for 2-hour wall)
- Automatically closing (spring hinge or closer)
- Self-latching (stays closed when released)
- Labeled for fire rating

**Penetrations through shaft wall:**
- All must be fire-stopped (see Section 3: Firestopping)
- Typical: plumbing drain (firestop collar), electrical conduit (firestop mortar)

### Building Code Requirement Summary

| Space Type | Typical Rating | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| Stairwell | 2-hour | Must separate stairwell from building |
| Elevator shaft | 1-2 hour | 2-hour if high-rise |
| Mechanical room | 1-hour | 2-hour if contains hazardous materials |
| Exit corridor | 1-hour | Some codes: 2-hour depending on height |
| Tenant separation (multi-tenant) | 1-hour | Separates one tenant from another |
| Demising wall (apartments) | 1-hour | Separates units |

### Critical Installation Errors (Common in Field)

**Error #1: Wrong gypsum type**
- Installing 5/8" "standard" instead of "Type X"
- Standard = poorer fire performance; assembly fails rating
- Type X = special core formulation (calcium silicate) with better fire resistance
- Verification: look at gypsum wrapper label (says "TYPE X")

**Error #2: Screw spacing too large**
- Installing screws 24" on center instead of 16"
- Wider spacing = gypsum flexes more = cracks develop = loses rating
- UL assembly specifies screw spacing (usually 12-16" typical)
- Verification: measure in field; document with photo

**Error #3: Wrong stud gauge**
- Using 20-gauge studs instead of 16-gauge (thinner metal)
- Lighter gauge = more flex = assembly fails test
- Verification: UL assembly number specifies gauge

**Error #4: Drywall tape skipped / poor mudding**
- Fast crew rushes, skips some joint tape
- Creates hairline cracks = fire path
- Drywall without tape = NOT rated assembly
- Verification: visual inspection; touch-test for tape continuity

**Error #5: Penetration not fire-stopped**
- Pipe through wall; no caulk/system applied
- Fire travels through gap around pipe
- Verification: pre-drywall inspection of all sleeves/penetrations

## 4. PENETRATION FIRE-STOPPING (Detailed)

### Types of Penetrations Requiring Fire-Stop

**Mechanical Penetrations:**
- Plumbing (hot water, cold water, waste, vent, condensate)
- HVAC (supply duct, return duct, exhaust, condensate drain)
- Refrigerant lines (HVAC)
- Gas lines (natural gas, medical gas)
- Steam lines (if present)

**Electrical Penetrations:**
- Electrical conduit (with or without wire inside)
- Cable tray (bundled cables)
- Single cables (power, controls, communications)

**Low-Voltage Penetrations:**
- Data cabling (CAT6, fiber optic)
- Security/alarm wiring
- Fire alarm wiring (critical)
- Telephone/intercom wiring

**Structural Openings:**
- Blank penetrations (future use, not yet filled)
- Sleeves without pipes (temporary or abandoned)

### Fire-Stop System Components

**Intumescent Material (Main Fire-Stopping Agent)**
- Expands when heated (swells up 5-10x original size)
- Blocks gas flow; insulates unexposed side
- Examples: intumescent caulk (red paste), intumescent wrap strips

**Mineral Fiber (Backing/Support)**
- Non-combustible fiber blanket or rope
- Provides backing for caulk (prevents falling through)
- Allows thermal expansion of caulk without squeezing out

**Mechanical Devices (For Large Openings)**
- Intumescent collar (clamps around pipe)
- Cast-in-place pockets (pre-made voids in floor/wall structure)
- Oversized sleeves with insert systems

**Caulk Base (Standard, Non-Rated)**
- Regular silicone or polyurethane (doesn't have fire rating)
- Used as "weatherproofing" around penetrations
- Does NOT meet fire-stop requirements by itself

### System Selection by Pipe Type

#### Metallic Pipe (Steel, Copper, Cast Iron)
**Best method:** Intumescent caulk + mineral fiber

**Installation:**
1. Drill hole (slightly larger than pipe OD)
2. Clean hole of all debris
3. Install metal ring/collar around pipe (optional but recommended)
4. Pack mineral fiber loosely into annular space (gap between sleeve and pipe)
   - Not compressed; allows expansion room
5. Caulk over mineral fiber with intumescent caulk
   - Minimum 5/8" depth (both sides of wall)
   - Caulk should be continuous (no voids)
6. Smooth caulk surface (for appearance)
7. Allow cure time (per manufacturer; typically 24 hours)

**UL System Example:**
- 3M CP25 intumescent caulk (red, odorous)
- Partnered with 3M mineral fiber (gray fibrous pad)
- UL listed system: CP25 + mineral fiber = 2-hour F & T rating in specified assemblies

**Why it works:**
- Metallic pipe doesn't melt (stays put during fire)
- Intumescent expands, fills gap, blocks flame
- Works for 1-hour and 2-hour rated walls

#### Plastic Pipe ≤4" (PVC, ABS, PEX, CPVC)
**Challenge:** Plastic melts in fire (typically melts at 150-200°F, much lower than 1000°F fire)

**Best method:** Intumescent wrap strip OR intumescent collar

**Installation:**
1. Wrap intumescent strip around pipe
   - Strip width typically 12-18 inches wide
   - Wrap covers 360° around pipe circumference
2. Overlap ends 2-3 inches (as specified)
3. Caulk seams and top edge with intumescent caulk
4. Caulk annular space (gap at wall/floor) per system requirements

**Why it works:**
- Intumescent expansion prevents pipe from melting through barrier
- Creates seal after plastic melts/shrinks
- Tested in UL labs for specific pipe sizes (critical: must match listing)

**Example product:**
- HILTI CFS-CP intumescent wrap (for 2" PVC plastic pipe in 1-hour assembly)
- Must be sized for specific pipe OD (1.5", 2", 4", etc. are different)

**Critical installation error:**
- Using wrong-sized wrap (wrap for 2" on 1.5" pipe = too loose; doesn't seal)
- Overlapping insufficient (less than overlap specified = rating lost)
- Not caulking seams (flame can find path through wrap edge)

#### Plastic Pipe >4" (Drain, Vent, Supply)
**Problem:** Large plastic pipe requires very large intumescent wrap; system becomes complex and expensive

**Best method:** UL-listed mechanical system specific to pipe size
- Examples: Ridgid or Victaulic fire-stop collar systems
- Mechanical device compresses around pipe; intumescent packing fills voids
- More expensive ($200-500 per penetration vs. $20-50 for caulk method)

**Why required:** Large diameter = large thermal mass + more melt = standard wrap insufficient

**Recommendation:** If large plastic pipe required through fire-rated assembly, consider specifying metallic instead (cast iron, ductile iron) to simplify fire-stopping.

#### Cable / Conduit Bundles
**Varies by cable density and assembly type:**

**Light density (cables <25% of opening):**
- Firestop mortar + caulk
- Mortar (crushed silica + intumescent binder) fills opening
- Caulk seals top/sides

**Medium density (cables 25-50% of opening):**
- Firestop pillows (porous blocks of intumescent + mineral fiber)
- Caulk between and around pillows
- Pillows compress in fire; intumescent expands

**High density (cables >50% of opening):**
- Must verify with designer/firestop engineer
- May require oversized sleeve with insert system
- Common issue: code allows only 40% cable fill; redesign required

**Example installation (medium density):**
1. Arrange cables neatly in opening
2. Install firestop pillows (pink, puffy blocks) around cables
3. Caulk seams between pillows with intumescent caulk
4. Caulk entire perimeter around cable bundle
5. Allow cure time

### Blank Openings (Future Penetrations)
**Requirement:** Cover blank openings (sleeves with no pipe) with firestop rating matching assembly

**Sizing limit:** Most firestop systems limited to 4" x 4" opening, 1" depth maximum

**Installation:**
1. Size opening to UL rating limit
2. Install firestop pillow or mortar rated for opening size
3. Seal with caulk around edges
4. Label: "FIRESTOP - DO NOT DISTURB"

**Larger blank openings:**
- Require damper or mechanical closure
- Costs $500-2000+ per opening
- Recommendation: minimize blank openings in design phase

### Minimum Caulk Depth Standards
- **All assemblies (1-hour or 2-hour):** 5/8 inch minimum depth on both sides
  - Depth = how far intumescent caulk packed into joint
  - Measured from surface (top of wall) downward
  - Both faces of wall must be caulked
- **No additional depth for 2-hour (stays 5/8")** — the difference is assembly base, not caulk thickness

### Installation Quality Control Points
1. **Annular space cleared:** All dust, spray foam, loose material removed
2. **Mineral fiber not compressed:** Loosely packed (allows thermal expansion)
3. **Caulk continuous:** No voids or gaps in bead
4. **Cure time respected:** No painting/taping over caulk until manufacturer cure time passed
5. **Documentation:** Every penetration photographed (date stamp) before wall closure

### Third-Party Firestop Inspection
**Common on commercial projects:**

**What inspector checks:**
- Material match (correct caulk/fiber for UL system)
- Proper seating (pipe/cable centered in sleeve)
- Caulk depth (5/8" minimum measured)
- Continuity (no voids or cracks)
- Labeling (firestop sign visible if required)

**Cost:** Typically $1000-3000 for small project; 2-3 hours per 100 penetrations

**Benefit:** Liability transfer (inspector certifies assembly meets code; contractor not solely responsible)

## 5. STANDPIPE REQUIREMENTS (IBC / NFPA 14)

### Standpipe Definition
**Vertical water supply line with hose connections** for fire department (Class I) or occupants (Class II/III) to connect and spray water during fire.

### Class I Standpipes (Most Common)
- **Hose connection size:** 2-1/2" female swivel (standard fire hose fitting)
- **Purpose:** Fire department use (professional firefighters with trained equipment operators)
- **Typical locations:** Every stairwell landing in 30+-foot buildings
- **Access:** Fire department connection (Siamese) on building exterior

### Class II Standpipes (Rare)
- **Hose connection size:** 1-1/2" (smaller hose, lower volume)
- **Purpose:** Occupant use (untrained civilians)
- **Typical locations:** Few modern buildings (complex liability issues)
- **Example:** Some covered malls, stages

### Class III Standpipes (Combination)
- **Both 2-1/2" AND 1-1/2" connections** at each location
- **Purpose:** Fire department (2-1/2") and occupant (1-1/2") use
- **Cost:** Roughly 1.5x Class I (both systems required)
- **Rare:** Used only in special occupancy types

### When Standpipe Required (IBC Trigger Points)

**Required when:**
1. **Highest floor >30 feet above fire department access level**
   - Typical multi-story building >3-4 floors in flat terrain
   - Basement level: counts as elevation below (may trigger requirement earlier)

2. **Covered mall buildings**
   - Any covered shopping mall (regardless of height)
   - For occupant evacuation + fire department access

3. **Underground buildings**
   - Basement floors >55 feet below grade
   - Example: large parking garage, subway station

4. **Stages, assembly areas**
   - Some jurisdictions require standpipe in theaters/auditoriums
   - Check local amendments

**NOT required in:**
- Single-story buildings (any height)
- 2-3 story buildings in most jurisdictions
- Low-rise office buildings (check locally)

### Standpipe Hose Connection Placement

**Class I System (30-foot building minimum):**
- One 2-1/2" connection at **every floor landing** in each exit stairwell
- Plus one connection on roof (highest landing)
- Example: 10-story building = 11 connections in stairwell A, 11 in stairwell B

**Connection placement details:**
- Within 4 feet of stairwell landing (fire department access)
- Height: 42-54 inches above floor (ADA-accessible reach range)
- Clearance: 18 inches on each side (hose connection and removal)
- Signage: "STANDPIPE" label above connection
- Visual: Red or yellow cabinet (standardized for fire department)

**Roof connection:**
- Accessible roof surface (not parapet)
- Near highest floor exit if possible
- Signage required

### Water Supply & Flow Requirements

**Minimum supply at standpipe system inlet:**
- **500 GPM** at 65 psi (minimum at most remote hose connection)
- Plus pressure for additional connections

**For multiple remote connections:**
- 1st connection: 500 GPM
- 2nd connection: 250 GPM additional (total 750 GPM)
- 3rd connection: 250 GPM additional (total 1000 GPM)
- **Maximum 1000 GPM** (3 simultaneous hose stations)

**Why low flow:** Fire department operates at 40-60 psi through 1.5"-diameter hose; doesn't need high volume from building pipe

**Supply source options:**
1. **City water main** (direct tie-in with pressure reducing valve)
   - Most common; reliable
   - Concern: If city main loses pressure (fire district), system fails
   - Solution: Add pump + storage tank (expensive)

2. **Pressure tank** (air-pressurized or hydro-pneumatic)
   - Provides pressure when city main insufficient
   - Requires pump to refill tank
   - Size: typically 500+ gallons

3. **Jockey pump** (small pump maintaining pressure)
   - Keeps system pressurized between uses
   - Prevents water-logged pipe (reduces response time)
   - Example: 5 hp pump running continuously at low volume

4. **Pump + tank combination** (backup during city main failure)
   - Fire pump (20+ hp) with large tank (1000+ gallons)
   - High reliability; high cost ($50,000+)
   - Typical for hospitals, high-occupancy buildings

### Common Standpipe Installation Errors

**Error #1: Hose connection too high or too low**
- Fire department can't easily connect nozzle (furniture in way, too high to reach)
- Requirement: 42-54" above floor (ADA range)
- Verification: Measure each connection; document with photo

**Error #2: Blocked access to connection**
- Furniture, storage, or drywall blocking connection area
- Fire department can't install hose quickly
- Verification: Clear 18" on each side; no obstructions visible

**Error #3: Insufficient water supply**
- Pressure drops below 65 psi when two hoses connected
- Result: inadequate flow for fire suppression
- Testing: Flow test during final inspection confirms supply

**Error #4: Missing roof connection**
- Roof access for fire department overlooked
- Requirement: Connection accessible from roof (not in parapet)
- Solution: Add roof connection (may require rework if building complete)

## 6. FIRE ALARM DEVICE SPACING (NFPA 72)

### Smoke Detectors (Ionization or Photoelectric)

**Spacing rule (Spot-Type):**
- **Maximum 30-foot spacing** between detectors
- **15 feet from walls** (perimeter offset)
- Grid pattern for large areas; tighter for small spaces

**Example layout:**
- 40' x 60' floor plate
- 30' x 30' coverage per detector
- Grid: 2 detectors down 40' x 2 detectors across 60' = 4 detectors minimum

**Placement location:**
- On ceiling (most common) — 4" minimum below ceiling
  - Smoke rises; detector needs to intercept before dispersing
  - Exception: sloped ceilings >45° pitch (place per manufacturer)
  - Exception: high-bay (>25') ceilings (use heat detector instead; smoke too dispersed)

- High sidewalls (alternative if ceiling access limited)
  - 4" below ceiling minimum; max 12" below ceiling
  - Full NFPA 72 spacing still applies

**Obstructions affecting coverage:**
- Ceiling beams, ducts, truss
- If beam/duct blocks ceiling area >10% of detector coverage = add detector
- Ventilation return air (airflow disperses smoke faster; tighter spacing needed)

### Heat Detectors (Fixed or Rate-of-Rise)

**Spacing varies by listed spacing rating:**
- **Standard spacing:** 30-foot maximum
- **Wide spacing rated:** 50-foot maximum (for listed wide-spacing heat detectors)
- Check manufacturer specification for exact spacing rating

**When to use heat instead of smoke:**
- High-bay warehouses (smoke too dispersed at height)
- Kitchens (smoke from cooking = false alarms with smoke detectors)
- Garages (vehicle exhaust smoke = false alarms)
- Mechanical rooms (steam/dust = false alarms)

**Placement:**
- Ceiling or high sidewall (same rules as smoke)
- Minimum 4" from ceiling
- No obstructions blocking heat circulation

### Pull Stations (Manual Alarm Devices)

**Location requirement:**
- **Within 5 feet of each exit**
  - Every door = occupant can access station without traveling far
  - Exit includes: stairwell exits, exterior exits, occupancy exit paths

**Height requirement:**
- **42-54 inches above floor** (ADA reach range)
  - Allows both able-bodied and wheelchair users to operate
  - Center of pull handle at 48" typical

**Spacing where not at exits:**
- Maximum 150 feet travel distance within building
- Ensure occupants don't walk >150' to reach station

**Labeling:**
- "FIRE ALARM" sign above or on station
- Red sign with white letters (standardized)
- Glow-in-dark label (for visibility during power loss)

### Horn / Strobe Notification Devices

**Sound level requirements (dB - decibels):**
- **Corridors:** Minimum 80 dB
- **General occupancy:** 80-90 dB typical
- **Bedrooms:** May require 75 dB (some codes lower for sleeping areas)
- **High-noise areas:** 90+ dB required

**Strobe flash requirements (cd - candela, brightness):**
- **Corridors:** 15 cd (candela) minimum
- **Open spaces:** 15 cd typical (hallways, lobbies, offices)
- **Large rooms:** 110 cd required (warehouse, big rooms)
  - Must be visible from any point in the room
  - Example: 100' x 100' space needs higher-intensity strobes

**Placement:**
- Minimum 80" above floor (top of device; visual clarity)
- 6 feet from corners (distributes flash uniformly)
- Spacing per NFPA 72 Table 18.5.4.3.1 (varies by flash rate and room size)

### Smoke Detector in Supply Air Duct

**Required when:**
- **Supply duct ≥2000 CFM**
  - Example: Main supply from HVAC unit = typically 5000+ CFM (required)
  - Branch ductwork: often <2000 CFM (not required)
- **Return duct ≥15,000 CFM**
  - Large return paths (plenums over ceiling) = require detector
  - Small return grilles: usually <15,000 CFM (not required)

**Purpose:** Detect fire/smoke in ductwork before it circulates through building

**Placement:**
- In duct (not on exterior wall)
- Accessible location for cleaning (accumulates dust)
- Activation: shuts down HVAC (prevents smoke spread)

**Sizing:**
- Duct detector listed for specific duct widths (6", 12", 24")
- Detector size must match duct dimensions
- Multi-flue ducts: may require multiple detectors

---

## 7. FIRE DEPARTMENT CONNECTION (FDC)

### Physical Connections & Location

**Exterior hose fitting:**
- **Type:** 2-1/2" female swivel x 2 (Siamese) OR Storz quick-connect
  - Siamese: two separate inlets combining into one large pipe (most common)
  - Storz: single quick-lock connection (less common, check local FD preference)
- **Connection size:** 4" diameter outlet pipe (fed to building system)

**Required location:**
- **Street-facing facade** (fire apparatus approach side)
- **Visible from street** (fire department can spot immediately)
- **Accessible to fire apparatus** (truck can approach, hose can reach)
- **Within 100 feet of nearest fire hydrant** (FD water source)
- **Clear of parked cars, landscaping, obstacles**

### Height & Installation

**Height above grade:**
- **18 inches minimum** (avoids splashing during use)
- **48 inches maximum** (reachable without ladder)
- Typical: 24-36 inches above finished grade

**Slope for drainage:**
- Connection should slope slightly downward (1/4" per foot) toward drain
- Drain: allows residual water to drain after FD disconnects (prevents freezing in winter)
- Drain hole: 1/4" diameter, lowest point of connection

**Support:**
- Heavy cast brass connection needs structural support (not hanging by pipe alone)
- Mounting: bolted to building wall or pedestal
- Vibration isolation: use rubber pads (prevents corrosion, reduces noise)

### Signage & Identification

**Sign requirements (all required):**
1. **"FIRE DEPT CONNECTION"** (black or red letters on reflective background)
   - Visible day and night
   - Lettering: minimum 1-inch tall

2. **System type** (which building system it serves):
   - "AUTO SPRINKLER" (sprinkler system)
   - "STANDPIPE" (standpipe hose system)
   - "COMBINED" (sprinkler + standpipe on same connection)
   - "FOAM" (foam suppression system, rare)

3. **Address/building identification**
   - Building street number clearly visible
   - Fire department uses for orientation

4. **Reflective color coding:**
   - Red reflective paint on connection cap and body
   - Night visibility for firefighters

### Maintenance & Testing

**Annual testing:**
- Connection integrity (no leaks)
- Flow test (ensure water reaches intended system)
- Pressure test (verify pump maintains pressure)

**Visual inspection quarterly:**
- Cap in place (prevents debris entry)
- No rust or corrosion damage
- Signage intact and readable
- Approach area clear of obstacles

**Common maintenance issues:**
- Rust inside connection (cast brass oxidizes in humid climate)
- Debris accumulation (leaves, dirt blocking inlet)
- Cap lost (water or insects enter; internal corrosion)
- Signage faded (not visible at night)

### Common FDC Installation Errors

**Error #1: Incorrect location**
- Installed on non-street-facing facade
- Hidden behind landscaping or parked cars
- Fire apparatus cannot reach
- Solution: Relocate to visible, accessible location

**Error #2: No signage**
- Connection present but unmarked
- Fire department may not identify purpose (sprinkler vs. standpipe)
- Result: Wrong hose connection attempted; system doesn't function
- Solution: Install required signage immediately

**Error #3: Insufficient drain**
- No drain hole or blocked drain
- Water freezes in connection during winter
- Ice ruptures connection; system inoperable in cold climates
- Solution: Install 1/4" drain at lowest point; verify drains water

**Error #4: Connection too high or low**
- Above 48" (requires ladder; firefighter safety issue)
- Below 18" (splashing water onto firefighters' boots/leg)
- Solution: Reinstall at 24-36" height

**Error #5: Too far from hydrant**
- >100 feet from nearest hydrant
- Code violation; must be brought into compliance
- Solution: Install additional hydrant or relocate FDC connection

## Important Note
**Local fire code amendments and AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction) requirements always govern.** These are general NFPA guidelines. Verify all requirements with local fire marshal + building department before installation. Codes vary by jurisdiction (state, county, city, district); some enforce stricter requirements than NFPA baseline.

## 8. FIRE ALARM SYSTEM TYPES AND COMPONENTS

### Conventional vs. Addressable Systems

**Conventional Fire Alarm Systems**
- How it works: Devices wired in zones (groups of devices on a single circuit); panel identifies which zone is in alarm, not which specific device
- Zones typically organized by floor, wing, or fire area
- Panel displays zone number when alarm activates
- Pros: lower initial cost, simpler installation, adequate for small buildings
- Cons: cannot identify specific device in alarm (zone only), troubleshooting harder, limited expandability
- When used: small buildings (<20,000 SF), simple layouts, budget-constrained projects, single-story retail

**Addressable Fire Alarm Systems**
- How it works: each device has a unique address (digital ID) on a signaling line circuit (SLC); panel identifies exact device in alarm
- Devices communicate digitally with panel (two-way communication)
- Panel displays specific device location, type, and status
- Pros: pinpoint device identification, easier troubleshooting, sensitivity adjustment per device, larger system capacity (hundreds of devices per SLC loop)
- Cons: higher initial cost, more complex programming, requires trained technician
- When used: large buildings, multi-story, campus environments, healthcare, high-rise, any project where rapid identification of alarm source is critical

**Field decision**: For buildings over 20,000 SF or more than 2 stories, addressable is the standard choice. Conventional systems are increasingly rare in new commercial construction.

### Detection Devices

**Smoke Detectors**

| Type | Detection Method | Best Application | Limitations |
|------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Ionization | Detects small particles (fast-flaming fires) | General office, corridors | Prone to nuisance alarms from cooking, dust |
| Photoelectric | Detects large particles (slow-smoldering fires) | Bedrooms, hotels, near kitchens | Slower response to fast-flaming fires |
| Beam detector | Projected light beam across large space; smoke breaks beam | Warehouses, atriums, large open areas (>40 ft ceiling) | Alignment critical; vibration can cause false alarms |
| Multi-criteria | Combines smoke + heat + CO sensing in one device | High-value areas requiring minimal false alarms | Higher cost per device; complex programming |

**Heat Detectors**

| Type | Detection Method | Best Application | Response Time |
|------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Fixed temperature | Activates at preset temp (typically 135 degrees F or 200 degrees F) | Garages, kitchens, mechanical rooms, areas with normal smoke/steam | Slower (must reach set temp) |
| Rate-of-rise | Activates when temp rises faster than 12-15 degrees F per minute | General areas where rapid fire growth expected | Faster than fixed temp |
| Combination | Both fixed temp and rate-of-rise in one device | Most common heat detector type installed | Best overall response |

**Duct Smoke Detectors**
- Installed in supply and return air ducts per NFPA 90A
- Purpose: detect smoke in HVAC system before distribution throughout building
- Required in supply ducts serving 2,000+ CFM and return ducts serving 15,000+ CFM
- Activation: shuts down associated HVAC unit (does not typically activate building fire alarm unless programmed to)
- Maintenance: high dust accumulation; clean per manufacturer schedule (typically annually)

### Notification Devices

**Horns (Audible Notification)**
- Sound output measured in decibels (dB) at 10 feet
- Minimum 15 dB above average ambient sound level, or 5 dB above maximum sound lasting 60+ seconds
- Sleeping areas: minimum 75 dB at pillow level (NFPA 72)
- Temporal pattern: standardized 3-pulse pattern (on-off-on-off-on-off) per NFPA 72 for evacuation signal

**Strobes (Visual Notification)**

| Room Size (Max Dimension) | Minimum Candela Rating | Typical Application |
|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 20 ft x 20 ft | 15 cd | Small offices, hotel rooms |
| 28 ft x 28 ft | 30 cd | Conference rooms, classrooms |
| 40 ft x 40 ft | 60 cd | Open offices, retail spaces |
| 54 ft x 54 ft | 110 cd | Warehouses, gyms, large assembly |

- Wall-mounted strobes: 80-96 inches AFF (above finished floor) to top of device
- Ceiling-mounted strobes: candela ratings differ from wall-mounted (check NFPA 72 tables)
- Flash rate: 1-2 Hz (synchronized within field of view to prevent photosensitive seizures)
- All visible notification devices within a space must be synchronized

**Speakers (Voice Evacuation)**
- Used in high-rise, healthcare, large assembly, mass notification systems
- Provide voice instructions instead of or in addition to tone signals
- Intelligibility requirement: 0.50 CIS (Common Intelligibility Scale) minimum per NFPA 72
- Advantage: targeted messaging (evacuate specific floors, shelter-in-place, all-clear)
- Requires voice evacuation panel with pre-recorded messages and live microphone capability

**Mass Notification Systems**
- Building-wide or campus-wide communication for emergencies beyond fire
- Integrates with fire alarm, security, weather alert systems
- Required in some occupancies (military, large campus, high-rise per local code)
- Priority hierarchy: mass notification overrides fire alarm signals when both active

### Zoning

**Conventional System Zoning**
- Maximum 22,500 SF per zone on one floor (NFPA 72)
- Each zone must be bounded by physical boundaries (walls, floors)
- Cannot cross fire barriers between smoke zones
- Minimum: one zone per floor in multi-story buildings
- Zone indicator maps at annunciator required for fire department orientation

**Addressable System Identification**
- Each device uniquely addressed: no zone size limitations
- Point-by-point identification on panel and annunciator
- Devices still organized into notification zones for alarm output (horn/strobe activation)
- Custom zones programmable: group devices by area, floor, or function
- Simplifies system expansion (add devices to existing SLC without rewiring)

### Annunciator Panel

**Location Requirements**
- Required at building main entrance (fire department entry point)
- Additional annunciators at each fire command center (high-rise)
- Must be visible and accessible within 10 feet of entry
- Protected from physical damage but not locked (fire department needs immediate access)

**Graphic Display Panels**
- Required in buildings with complex layouts or multiple fire zones
- Shows floor plan with device locations, zone boundaries, alarm/supervisory status
- LED or LCD indicators for each zone/device
- Updated as system is modified (reflects current building conditions)

**Remote Annunciators**
- Located at secondary entrances, fire command centers, security desks
- Mirror main panel information (alarm, supervisory, trouble)
- Connected via dedicated communication circuit

### Alarm Verification vs. Pre-Alarm vs. Alarm

**Alarm Verification**
- Panel confirms alarm condition by re-sampling detector after initial signal
- Typical delay: 15-60 seconds
- Purpose: reduce false alarms from transient conditions (dust, insects, air currents)
- Cannot be used on manual pull stations or sprinkler waterflow (immediate alarm required)

**Pre-Alarm (Alert)**
- Detector sensitivity reaches warning threshold before full alarm threshold
- Notifies maintenance/security staff of potential issue
- Does not activate building notification devices
- Allows investigation before full evacuation
- Common in addressable systems with adjustable sensitivity

**Alarm**
- Full alarm condition: notification devices activated, HVAC shutdown, elevator recall, door unlock
- No delay permitted once alarm threshold reached (except alarm verification on automatic detectors)
- Initiates all programmed sequences per sequence of operations

## 9. SMOKE CONTROL SYSTEMS

### Stairwell Pressurization

**Purpose**: Prevent smoke infiltration into exit stairwells during fire, maintaining tenable conditions for occupant evacuation and firefighter access.

**Pressure Requirements (per IBC)**
- Minimum: 0.05 inches water gauge (w.g.) with all stairwell doors closed
- Maximum: 0.35 inches water gauge with all stairwell doors closed
- Door opening force: maximum 30 lbs to open from stairwell side (ADA requirement)
- Pressure must be maintained with one door open on the fire floor plus the ground floor exit door open simultaneously

**System Components**
- Dedicated pressurization fan(s): typically roof-mounted or at top of stairwell shaft
- Supply air duct or shaft connecting fan to stairwell (multiple injection points for tall buildings)
- Barometric relief dampers: prevent over-pressurization when all doors closed
- Pressure sensors: monitor differential pressure at multiple floors
- Controls: fan starts on fire alarm activation; modulates to maintain pressure range

**Design Considerations**
- Single injection point adequate for buildings up to approximately 8 stories
- Multiple injection points (every 3-4 floors) for taller buildings to ensure uniform pressure distribution
- Stack effect in tall buildings: pressure differential changes with height and outdoor temperature
- Wind effect: external wind on doors can overcome pressurization; design must account for worst-case wind

### Exhaust Method Smoke Control

**Large Open Areas**
- Mechanical exhaust removes smoke from large volume spaces (convention centers, malls, warehouses)
- Exhaust rate calculated based on fire size, ceiling height, and space geometry
- Minimum exhaust capacity maintains smoke layer above 6 feet (occupant head height) for design fire duration

**Atrium Smoke Control**
- Required for atriums connecting more than 2 stories per IBC 404
- Natural smoke filling: calculate time for smoke to descend to occupied level
- Mechanical exhaust: sized to maintain smoke layer above highest occupied floor connecting to atrium
- Makeup air: required to replace exhausted air (typically at lower levels); velocity must not exceed 200 FPM at any point to avoid disrupting smoke layer
- Tenability criteria: visibility, temperature, and CO levels must remain within survivable limits at occupied levels

### Ductwork Routing for Smoke Control

**Fire-Rated Shaft Requirements**
- Smoke control ductwork routed through fire-rated shafts must maintain shaft rating
- Shaft penetrations require fire/smoke dampers at each floor connection
- Ductwork within rated shafts: must be steel (no fiberglass ductboard, no flex duct)
- Shaft construction: same rating as floor assembly it passes through (typically 2-hour in high-rise)

**Fire Damper Locations**
- At every penetration of a fire-rated wall or floor assembly
- At duct connection to vertical shaft
- At boundary of smoke zones
- At rated corridor walls (where ductwork crosses corridor boundary)

### Damper Types

**Fire Dampers**
- Purpose: prevent passage of flame through duct penetration in fire-rated assembly
- Activation: fusible link melts at rated temperature (typically 165 degrees F)
- Closes by spring or gravity
- Rating: matches or exceeds wall/floor rating (1.5-hour damper for 1-hour wall; 3-hour for 2-hour wall)
- Static vs. dynamic: static dampers rated for airflow OFF; dynamic dampers rated with airflow ON

**Smoke Dampers**
- Purpose: prevent passage of smoke through duct
- Activation: electric or pneumatic actuator, controlled by fire alarm system or smoke detector
- Can be reopened by control system (unlike fire dampers)
- Used at smoke barrier boundaries, in engineered smoke control systems

**Combination Fire/Smoke Dampers**
- Provides both fire resistance (fusible link) and smoke control (actuator)
- Most common type in modern construction
- Allows smoke control operation during fire event while maintaining fire barrier integrity
- Requires both fire alarm connection and fusible link
- Access door required for inspection and testing (minimum 16" x 16" or per manufacturer)

### Interlocks and Sequences

**HVAC Shutdown Sequences**
- Fire alarm activation: all HVAC units serving affected zone shut down
- Duct smoke detector activation: associated unit shuts down (not necessarily building-wide)
- Smoke control mode: dedicated smoke control fans start; non-smoke-control units remain off
- Sequence timing: HVAC shutdown within 60 seconds of alarm; smoke control fans start within 60 seconds of HVAC shutdown

**Elevator Recall**
- Phase I recall per ASME A17.1: elevators return to designated landing (typically lobby) on fire alarm
- If smoke detected at designated landing: elevators recall to alternate landing
- Firefighters' service (Phase II): manual control available to fire department after Phase I complete

**Door Unlock**
- Magnetic locks on access-controlled doors: unlock on fire alarm activation
- Delayed egress locks: 15-second maximum delay with alarm sounding, release on fire alarm or sprinkler activation
- Stairwell re-entry: doors unlock to allow re-entry from stairwell on fire alarm

### Testing

**Door Force Testing**
- Measure force required to open stairwell door with pressurization system running
- Maximum 30 lbs force to set door in motion (ADA requirement)
- Maximum 15 lbs to swing door to fully open position
- Test at every stairwell door on every floor
- If force exceeds limits: adjust fan speed, add relief dampers, or modify door closer

**Pressure Differential Measurements**
- Measure with manometer at each floor level (door closed)
- Record pressure with all doors closed and with design number of doors open
- Minimum 0.05" w.g. across stairwell door (closed) must be maintained
- Maximum 0.35" w.g. must not be exceeded

**Acceptance Criteria**
- All pressure readings within 0.05" to 0.35" w.g. range
- Door force within 30 lb limit at all locations
- Fan operation verified on fire alarm activation
- Damper operation verified (barometric relief opens at proper pressure)
- Backup power: system must operate on emergency power for full rated duration
- Documentation: test report signed by testing engineer and AHJ

## 10. EMERGENCY POWER INTEGRATION

### UPS Systems (Uninterruptible Power Supply)

**Purpose**: Provide immediate, gap-free power to critical fire and life safety loads during utility power loss.

**Battery Sizing**
- Capacity rated in kVA (kilovolt-amperes) and minutes of runtime
- Fire alarm systems: minimum 24 hours standby + 5 minutes alarm per NFPA 72
- Emergency lighting: minimum 90 minutes per IBC/NEC
- Smoke control: UPS typically not used (generator-backed instead)
- Sizing formula: total connected load (watts) x required runtime (hours) / battery efficiency (0.8 typical) = required battery capacity (watt-hours)

**Bypass Procedures**
- Internal bypass: automatic transfer to utility when UPS fails (seamless to loads)
- Maintenance bypass: manual switch allows UPS servicing without de-energizing loads
- External bypass: wrap-around switch isolates entire UPS for replacement
- Test bypass function quarterly; document transfer time (should be <4 milliseconds for online UPS)

**Testing Requirements**
- Monthly: visual inspection, battery voltage check, alarm test
- Semi-annual: load bank test (discharge batteries to verify capacity)
- Annual: full discharge test to verify rated runtime
- Battery replacement: typically every 3-5 years (VRLA) or 10-20 years (flooded cell)

### Generator Systems

**Transfer Time Requirements**
- Standard emergency systems (NEC Article 700): 10 seconds maximum
- Health care facilities (NEC Article 517): 10 seconds maximum for life safety and critical branches
- Health care essential electrical system: 0.5 seconds for critical care areas (requires UPS or stored energy)
- Legally required standby (NEC Article 701): 60 seconds maximum
- Optional standby (NEC Article 702): no specific transfer time requirement

**Fuel Supply**
- Day tank: integral or adjacent tank, typically 1-4 hours runtime capacity
- Main tank: bulk storage, sized for 24-96 hours runtime depending on facility type and code
- Fuel testing: test fuel quality annually (water, microbial growth, degradation)
- Fuel polishing: filter and recirculate stored diesel every 6-12 months
- Storage requirements: secondary containment, spill prevention, distance from buildings per fire code
- Dual fuel (diesel/natural gas): provides unlimited run time on natural gas with diesel backup

**Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS)**
- Function: monitors utility power; transfers loads to generator on utility failure; retransfers when utility restored
- Maintenance: exercise monthly under load (30 minutes minimum per NFPA 110)
- Testing: annual transfer test with full building load; measure transfer time
- Withstand and closing ratings: must match or exceed available fault current at installation point
- Open transition vs. closed transition: open = momentary power interruption during transfer; closed = no interruption (more expensive)

### Progressive Loading

**Startup Sequence to Prevent Generator Overload**
1. Generator starts and reaches rated voltage/frequency (typically 10 seconds)
2. ATS transfers life safety loads first (emergency lighting, fire alarm, exit signs)
3. 5-10 second delay: legally required standby loads transfer (smoke control, elevators)
4. 5-10 second delay: optional standby loads transfer (HVAC, general lighting if connected)
5. Total sequence: typically 20-30 seconds from utility failure to full load transfer

**Why progressive loading matters**: Simultaneous connection of all loads causes voltage/frequency dip that can trip generator offline. Motor loads (HVAC, pumps, elevators) have high inrush current at startup.

**Load shedding**: If generator approaches capacity, non-critical loads automatically disconnect (optional standby first, then legally required standby). Life safety loads are never shed.

### Load Classification (NEC)

**Emergency Loads (Article 700)**
- Exit signs and means of egress illumination
- Fire alarm systems
- Fire pump (if only power source)
- Elevator cab lighting, communication, and signal systems
- Emergency communication systems
- Must operate for minimum duration specified by code (typically 90 minutes to 2 hours)

**Legally Required Standby (Article 701)**
- Smoke control and stairwell pressurization systems
- Elevators (for firefighter access)
- Sewage disposal and sump pumps (where failure creates hazard)
- Communication systems (public address, mass notification)
- Heating for occupied spaces in cold climates (prevent frozen pipes, occupant safety)

**Optional Standby (Article 702)**
- HVAC systems (comfort, not life safety)
- General lighting beyond means of egress
- Data/IT systems (if not critical infrastructure)
- Food storage refrigeration
- Business-critical but not life-safety loads

## 11. SYSTEM INTEGRATION TESTING

### Fire Alarm to HVAC Shutdown

**Test procedure:**
1. Activate fire alarm in each zone (pull station or detector activation)
2. Verify all HVAC units serving that zone shut down within 60 seconds
3. Verify supply and return fans stop
4. Verify fire/smoke dampers close at zone boundaries (visual confirmation at each damper)
5. Verify exhaust fans shut down (unless designated for smoke control)
6. Reset fire alarm; verify HVAC units restart (automatic or manual per design)
7. Document: zone activated, units affected, shutdown time, damper position, restart method

**Common failures:**
- HVAC unit wired to wrong zone (shuts down on adjacent zone alarm, not its own)
- Damper actuator not connected or wired backward (damper opens instead of closes)
- Time delay too long (HVAC runs for several minutes after alarm)
- Fan does not restart after alarm reset (interlock wired for latch, not momentary)

### Fire Alarm to Elevator Recall

**Phase I Recall Test (per ASME A17.1)**
1. Activate fire alarm on any floor (not lobby level)
2. Verify all elevators begin traveling to designated landing (lobby) within 60 seconds
3. Elevator doors open and remain open at designated landing
4. Hall call buttons non-functional (elevator does not respond to calls)
5. Test alternate recall: activate smoke detector at lobby level
6. Verify elevators recall to alternate designated landing (not lobby)
7. Document: alarm zone, elevator car number, recall destination, travel time

**Phase II Firefighter Operation Test**
1. After Phase I recall complete, insert firefighter key in car operating panel
2. Verify car operates on manual control only (door open/close by button only)
3. Verify door does not auto-close (firefighter controls door timing)
4. Test at each floor: car stops only where directed by operator
5. Test emergency stop and intercom
6. Remove key: verify elevator returns to Phase I recall mode
7. Document: each car tested, each floor visited, all functions verified

### Fire Alarm to Door Unlock

**Magnetic Lock (Mag Lock) Release Test**
1. Verify mag lock holds door closed under normal conditions
2. Activate fire alarm
3. Verify mag lock releases within 1 second of alarm activation
4. Door should swing freely (no re-lock until alarm reset)
5. Test request-to-exit (REX) button: door releases independent of fire alarm
6. Reset fire alarm: verify mag lock re-engages
7. Document: each door location, release time, re-lock confirmation

**Delayed Egress Lock Test**
1. Push on door with delayed egress lock
2. Verify alarm sounds at door
3. Verify door releases within 15 seconds (30 seconds in some jurisdictions with approval)
4. Activate fire alarm: verify door releases immediately (overrides delay)
5. Activate sprinkler waterflow: verify door releases immediately
6. Document: each delayed egress door, delay time, override functions

**Access Control Integration**
- All access-controlled doors on egress paths must unlock on fire alarm
- Verify fail-safe (power loss = door unlocks) vs. fail-secure (power loss = door locks) per application
- Egress doors must be fail-safe: loss of power or fire alarm = unlocked
- Re-entry doors (stairwell) may be fail-secure in non-alarm condition but must unlock on fire alarm

### Fire Alarm to Stairwell Pressurization

**Test procedure:**
1. Activate fire alarm
2. Verify pressurization fan starts within 60 seconds
3. Measure pressure differential at each stairwell door (closed): 0.05" to 0.35" w.g.
4. Open fire floor door and ground floor door simultaneously
5. Verify pressure remains above 0.05" w.g. at all closed doors
6. Measure door opening force: maximum 30 lbs
7. Verify barometric relief dampers open to prevent over-pressurization
8. Reset fire alarm: verify fan stops (or remains running per design)
9. Document: fan start time, pressure readings at each floor, door force measurements

### Sequence of Operations Documentation

**Required content:**
- Input device (trigger): specific alarm zone, device type, location
- Output action: specific equipment response, timing, sequence
- Matrix format: rows = input triggers, columns = output actions
- Every combination documented (which alarm activates which response)
- Include normal mode, alarm mode, supervisory mode, trouble mode
- Include reset/restore sequences

### Integration Test Procedure Template

**Pre-test preparation:**
1. Notify building occupants and monitoring company of testing
2. Place fire alarm on test mode (prevents dispatch)
3. All trades on standby: fire alarm, HVAC, elevator, electrical, access control
4. Test instruments ready: manometer, sound level meter, stopwatch, force gauge
5. Test forms prepared with expected results for each sequence

**Test execution:**
1. Test each input trigger individually (one alarm zone at a time)
2. Verify each expected output per sequence of operations matrix
3. Record actual results vs. expected results
4. Note any deviations (unexpected responses or missing responses)
5. Reset system between each test sequence
6. Verify all systems return to normal after reset

**Post-test documentation:**
1. Complete test report with all measured values
2. List all deficiencies requiring correction
3. Assign corrective action responsibility and deadline
4. Schedule retest for any failed sequences
5. Final sign-off by testing engineer, fire alarm contractor, and AHJ

## 12. FIRE PUMP DETAIL

### Pump Types

**Horizontal Split Case**
- Most common type for commercial fire protection
- Motor-driven (electric) or diesel engine-driven
- Capacity range: 250-5,000 GPM
- Advantages: easy maintenance (split casing allows impeller access without disturbing piping), high efficiency, long service life
- Installation: requires concrete housekeeping pad, adequate clearance for casing removal
- Suction and discharge: inline or offset, flanged connections

**Vertical Turbine**
- Used when water source is below pump (ground-level tank, underground reservoir, well)
- Multi-stage impellers in vertical column
- Capacity range: 250-5,000 GPM
- Advantages: no priming required (submerged intake), suitable for low-suction-head applications
- Installation: requires pit or can (below-grade suction chamber)
- Common in: tank-based systems, areas with low municipal pressure

**End Suction**
- Compact design, single impeller
- Capacity range: up to 1,500 GPM (smaller systems)
- Advantages: smaller footprint, lower cost for small systems
- Limitations: lower efficiency than split case at high capacity
- Common in: small commercial, residential high-rise supplement

### Sizing

**Based on Hydraulic Calculation**
- Fire pump capacity determined by sprinkler system hydraulic calculation (not estimated)
- Calculation determines total flow demand (GPM) and total pressure required (PSI)
- Fire pump must supply the difference between system demand and available municipal supply
- Minimum pump size: 500 GPM (NFPA 20 minimum for listed fire pumps)

**Typical Capacity Ranges by Building Type**

| Building Type | Typical Pump Size | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Small commercial / retail | 500-750 GPM | Light hazard sprinkler system |
| Mid-rise office | 750-1,000 GPM | Ordinary hazard, standpipe demand |
| High-rise | 1,000-1,500 GPM | Combined sprinkler + standpipe |
| Warehouse / industrial | 1,500-2,500 GPM | High hazard, large area |
| Large complex / campus | 2,000-5,000 GPM | Multiple buildings, high demand |

### Acceptance Testing

**Flow Test Procedure (per NFPA 20)**
1. **0% flow (churn/shutoff)**: Close all test valves; record suction pressure, discharge pressure, and pump speed
2. **100% rated flow**: Open test header to achieve rated GPM; record pressures and speed
3. **150% rated flow**: Open additional test valves to achieve 150% of rated GPM; record pressures and speed
4. Run at each condition for minimum 30 minutes (some AHJs require longer)
5. Record all data points on pump test form

**Pump Curve Verification**
- Plot test results against manufacturer pump curve
- Churn pressure (0% flow): must not exceed 140% of rated pressure (prevents overpressure of system)
- Rated pressure (100% flow): must meet or exceed design point pressure
- 150% flow pressure: must not drop below 65% of rated pressure
- If test results do not match curve: investigate impeller condition, suction issues, motor/engine speed

**Pass/Fail Criteria**
- Pump must deliver rated flow at rated pressure (minimum)
- Pump must not cavitate (suction pressure adequate)
- No excessive vibration (check bearing mounts, alignment)
- No leaks at packing gland or mechanical seal (minor weeping acceptable at packing)
- Engine-driven: verify fuel supply, cooling, exhaust, battery charging all functional
- Electric: verify voltage, amperage within motor nameplate ratings

### Maintenance and Testing Requirements (NFPA 25)

**Weekly Test**
- Run pump for minimum 10 minutes (electric) or 30 minutes (diesel)
- Electric: test under no-flow (churn) conditions
- Diesel: test under no-flow conditions; check oil pressure, water temperature, battery charge
- Record suction pressure, discharge pressure, speed
- Compare to baseline (initial acceptance test values)

**Monthly Test**
- All weekly items plus:
- Inspect pump room for cleanliness, proper temperature (above 40 degrees F minimum)
- Check valve positions (all supply and control valves in correct position)
- Inspect controller for alarms, trouble conditions
- Test alarm notification to monitoring station

**Annual Test**
- Full flow test per acceptance test procedure (0%, 100%, 150%)
- Compare results to original acceptance test and previous annual test
- Degradation >5% from original indicates maintenance needed
- Inspect and service per manufacturer requirements
- Electrical testing: megger motor windings, check connections

### Jockey Pump

**Purpose**
- Small pump that maintains system pressure between fire pump operations
- Prevents main fire pump from starting due to minor pressure drops (leaks, thermal contraction, gauge fluctuation)
- Extends main fire pump life by reducing unnecessary starts

**Sizing**
- Flow: approximately 1% of fire pump rated capacity (e.g., 10 GPM for 1,000 GPM fire pump)
- Pressure: set slightly above fire pump start pressure (typically 5-10 PSI above fire pump start setpoint)
- Example: fire pump starts at 100 PSI; jockey pump maintains 105-110 PSI

**Short-Cycle Troubleshooting**
- Short cycling: jockey pump starts and stops frequently (more than 6 times per hour indicates problem)
- Common causes:
  - System leak (most common): water escaping through valve, fitting, or damaged piping
  - Waterlogged pressure tank: air cushion lost, causing rapid pressure changes
  - Pressure switch differential too narrow: adjust to wider band (5-10 PSI spread)
  - Check valve failure: water flowing backward through jockey pump on shutdown
- Investigation: isolate system sections to locate leak; check pressure tank air charge; verify check valve seating

### Controller Requirements

**Automatic Controller (Standard)**
- Starts fire pump automatically on system pressure drop
- Pressure switch setpoint: set below jockey pump maintain pressure (e.g., main pump starts at 95 PSI if jockey maintains 105 PSI)
- Sequential start if multiple pumps: first pump starts; if pressure continues to drop, second pump starts after time delay
- Manual start capability required (local and remote)
- Transfer switch (engine-driven): automatic transfer to alternate power source
- Alarms: pump running, power failure, phase reversal, controller trouble

**Non-Automatic Controller**
- Requires manual start by operator
- Used only where code permits and system design allows response time
- Less common; most AHJs require automatic operation

**Fire Pump Transfer Switch**
- Separate from building ATS (not on emergency generator circuit unless specifically designed)
- Provides alternate power source for electric fire pump
- Transfer time not critical (pump has pressurized water available during transfer)
- Some installations use dedicated fire pump generator
- Must be listed for fire pump service per NFPA 20
