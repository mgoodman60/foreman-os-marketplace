## 1. CMU (CONCRETE MASONRY UNIT) TYPES

### Standard CMU Sizes and Uses

| Unit Type | Nominal Size (W x H x L) | Actual Size | Weight (Normal) | Primary Use |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Standard Stretcher** | 8" x 8" x 16" | 7-5/8" x 7-5/8" x 15-5/8" | 35-40 lbs | Standard wall construction |
| **Half Block** | 8" x 8" x 8" | 7-5/8" x 7-5/8" x 7-5/8" | 18-22 lbs | Corners, ends, openings |
| **Solid Bottom (A-Block)** | 8" x 8" x 16" | Same | 38-42 lbs | Bond beam courses, lintels |
| **Lintel Block (U-Block)** | 8" x 8" x 16" | Same (open top) | 30-35 lbs | Lintels over openings, bond beams |
| **Bond Beam Block** | 8" x 8" x 16" | Same (knockout webs) | 33-38 lbs | Horizontal reinforcement courses |
| **Pilaster Block** | 16" x 8" x 16" | 15-5/8" x 7-5/8" x 15-5/8" | 55-65 lbs | Column/pilaster construction |
| **Half-High** | 8" x 4" x 16" | 7-5/8" x 3-5/8" x 15-5/8" | 20-24 lbs | Coursing adjustments, sills |
| **12" Standard** | 12" x 8" x 16" | 11-5/8" x 7-5/8" x 15-5/8" | 48-55 lbs | Foundation walls, retaining walls |

### CMU Grades and Weight Classes

**Grades (ASTM C90):**
- **Grade N (Normal):** For use above and below grade, exposed to weather and moisture — **use this for exterior walls, foundations, retaining walls**
- **Grade S (Special application):** Above grade only, moderate exposure — interior partitions and protected walls only

**Weight Classes:**
| Class | Unit Weight (PCF) | Wall Weight (8" wall, PSF) | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------------|-------|
| **Normal Weight** | 125+ PCF | 55-60 PSF | Strongest, best sound transmission class, heaviest |
| **Medium Weight** | 105-125 PCF | 45-55 PSF | Compromise — good strength, easier to handle |
| **Lightweight** | <105 PCF | 35-45 PSF | Easiest to handle, best insulation value, lower strength |

### CMU Strength

- **Typical f'm (masonry compressive strength):** 1,500-3,000 PSI depending on unit, mortar, and grout
- **Prism testing:** Required for structural masonry — build test prisms from same units/mortar/grout used in construction; test at 28 days
- **Unit strength method (alternative):** Use CMU and mortar strengths from tables in TMS 402 to calculate f'm without prism testing — acceptable for most projects
- **Minimum CMU compressive strength:** 1,900 PSI net area (ASTM C90)
- **Field check:** Verify CMU supplier certifications match project spec before first delivery

## 2. MORTAR TYPES

### Mortar Selection Table

| Type | Compressive Strength (28-day) | Best Use | Do NOT Use For |
|------|-------------------------------|----------|----------------|
| **Type M** | 2,500 PSI minimum | Below-grade walls, foundations, retaining walls, severe exposure, manholes | Unnecessary for above-grade unless specified |
| **Type S** | 1,800 PSI minimum | **Most common** — structural masonry, exterior walls, high wind/seismic zones, lateral load resistance | Interior non-load-bearing (overkill) |
| **Type N** | 750 PSI minimum | Non-structural above-grade, interior partitions, moderate exterior exposure | Below grade, high lateral loads, structural walls |
| **Type O** | 350 PSI minimum | Interior non-load-bearing partitions, minimal commercial use | Anything structural, any exterior, any wet location |

**Field Rule of Thumb:** When in doubt, **Type S** — it covers 90% of commercial construction applications.

### Mortar Proportions (by volume)

| Type | Portland Cement | Hydrated Lime | Sand | Notes |
|------|-----------------|---------------|------|-------|
| **M** | 1 | 1/4 | 3 to 3-3/4 | Or 1 cement + 1/4 lime, or masonry cement Type M |
| **S** | 1 | 1/4 to 1/2 | 3 to 3-3/4 | Or masonry cement Type S; most common structural |
| **N** | 1 | 1/2 to 1-1/4 | 3 to 3-3/4 | More lime = more workability, less strength |
| **O** | 1 | 1-1/4 to 2-1/2 | 3 to 3-3/4 | Very workable, very weak |

**Sand proportion:** Always 2.25 to 3 times the sum of cement + lime by volume. Over-sanded mortar is weak and crumbly.

### Field Mortar Rules

- **Mix mortar in clean mixer** — no residual from previous batches of different type
- **Add water to achieve workable consistency** — slump approximately 6-8" (mortar cone test)
- **Retempering (adding water to restore workability):** Permitted ONCE, within 2 hours of initial mixing, add water only — never add cement
- **Discard mortar after 2.5 hours** from initial mixing — no exceptions, even if it looks workable
- **Pre-bagged mortar:** Follow manufacturer's printed instructions exactly — do not add lime or cement
- **Color mortar:** Use integral pigments only — never add field colorants without engineer/architect approval
- **Cold weather:** Mortar temperature at placement must be 40-120°F; heat mixing water if needed (not above 160°F)

## 3. BOND PATTERNS

### Standard Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Use | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-----|-------|
| **Running Bond** | Each course offset 1/2 block from course below | Standard for almost all structural masonry | Default pattern — use unless drawings show otherwise |
| **Stack Bond** | All head joints aligned vertically | Decorative, modern aesthetic | Requires horizontal joint reinforcement at every course; structurally weaker |
| **Flemish Bond** | Alternating stretchers and headers in each course | Decorative brick walls | Rarely used in CMU; common in brick |
| **Soldier Course** | Units standing vertical (tall dimension up) | Band courses, lintels, accents | Non-structural accent — requires lintel support if spanning opening |
| **Header Course** | Units turned perpendicular to wall face | Ties wythes together in multi-wythe walls | Structural function in cavity walls |
| **Rowlock Course** | Units on edge, face perpendicular to wall | Window sills, cap courses | Provides sloped surface for water shedding |

---

## 4. GROUTING

### Grout Types

| Type | Aggregate Size | Minimum Cell/Space Size | Slump |
|------|---------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Fine Grout** | Sand only (max 3/8" aggregate) | 2" x 3" minimum cell dimension | 8-11 inches (fluid) |
| **Coarse Grout** | Pea gravel (3/8-1/2" aggregate) | 3" x 3" minimum cell dimension | 8-11 inches (fluid) |

**Rule:** Grout must be FLUID — it needs to flow into cells and around rebar. Target 8-11" slump. This is NOT like structural concrete — it should pour like thick soup.

### Grout Pour Procedures

**Pour Height Limits:**
- **Fine grout:** Maximum 4-foot lifts
- **Coarse grout:** Maximum 5-foot lifts
- **Exception:** Higher lifts up to 12 feet permitted with cleanout openings and approved grout demonstration (TMS 402/602)

**Consolidation:**
- **Vibrate or puddle all grout** — low-lift (under 5') can use puddling stick; high-lift requires mechanical vibrator
- **Vibrator:** 1" diameter pencil vibrator for CMU cells; immerse vibrator to bottom of lift
- **Reconsolidate** within 3-5 minutes after initial consolidation to address settlement
- **Do NOT vibrate against rebar** — displaces bar position

**Cleanout Openings:**
- **Required when grout pour height exceeds 5 feet** — provides access to remove mortar droppings and debris before grouting
- **Location:** Bottom of wall, every 32 inches of wall length (every other cell minimum)
- **Size:** Large enough to allow removal of debris — minimum 3" x 3" opening
- **Procedure:** Inspect and clean cells, seal cleanout openings, then grout
- **Waive cleanouts:** Only with approved grout demonstration per TMS 602

### Grout Testing

- **Grout prisms:** Cast in CMU units (absorb water, simulating actual conditions) — NOT in standard concrete cylinders
- **Minimum grout compressive strength:** 2,000 PSI at 28 days (typical spec), but must equal or exceed f'm
- **Field verification:** 1 set of prisms per 50 CY of grout or per day of grouting, whichever is more frequent

---

## 5. REBAR IN MASONRY

### Vertical Reinforcement

- **Placed in grouted cells** per structural drawings — verify cell locations before masonry starts
- **Bar sizes:** Typically #4, #5, or #6 in standard 8" CMU (larger bars require 10" or 12" CMU)
- **Maximum bar size in 8" CMU:** Typically #6 (check project specs — some limit to #5)
- **Centering:** Bar must be centered in the cell — use positioning clips or centering devices
- **Minimum cover:** 1/2" from inside face of CMU shell to face of grout (for fire rating, check code)
- **Lap splices:** Minimum **40 bar diameters** (typical) — #5 bar = 40 x 0.625" = 25" minimum lap
- **Dowels from foundation:** Project into CMU cells minimum lap splice length; position before first course

### Horizontal Reinforcement

- **Bond beam rebar:** Placed in bond beam or lintel blocks — typically #4 or #5 bars
- **Bond beam spacing:** Per structural drawings — typical 4 feet OC (every 6th course for 8" high CMU)
- **At minimum:** Bond beam at top of wall, at floor/roof bearing, above and below openings
- **Joint reinforcement (ladder or truss type):** Placed in mortar bed joints — typically every other course (16" OC) for crack control
- **Joint reinforcement is NOT structural reinforcement** — it controls shrinkage cracking only
- **Lap joint reinforcement minimum 6 inches** at splices

### Rebar Placement Checklist

- [ ] Verify bar sizes and locations match structural drawings
- [ ] Check that cells designated for rebar are clear of mortar droppings
- [ ] Bars centered in cells with positioning devices
- [ ] Lap splice lengths meet minimum (40 db or as specified)
- [ ] Vertical bars plumb — check at each bond beam level
- [ ] Horizontal bond beam bars properly positioned with cover
- [ ] Joint reinforcement in correct courses, lapped at splices
- [ ] No bar conflicts at intersections — resolve before grouting

## 6. BRICK VENEER

### Wall Ties

- **Spacing:** Maximum **1 tie per 2.67 SF** of wall area
- **Horizontal spacing:** Maximum **32 inches** on center
- **Vertical spacing:** Maximum **18 inches** on center (every third brick course for standard brick)
- **At openings:** Additional ties within **12 inches** of all window and door jambs
- **Tie types:** Adjustable (two-piece), corrugated metal strip, or wire ties — adjustable preferred for cavity walls
- **Tie embedment:** Minimum 1-1/2" into mortar joint; minimum 5/8" mortar cover on exterior face
- **Corrosion protection:** Hot-dip galvanized or stainless steel (stainless for coastal/high-exposure)

### Weep Holes

- **Spacing:** Every **24-33 inches** on center at base of wall (24" OC is best practice)
- **Location:** Directly above flashing at base course, above shelf angles, above lintels, above any flashing location
- **Types:** Open head joint, cotton rope wicks, plastic tubes, or manufactured weep vents
- **Open head joints preferred** — most effective drainage; use insect screens in openings
- **Do NOT mortar weep holes closed** — this is the #1 brick veneer defect; water trapped in cavity causes efflorescence, freeze damage, and structural deterioration

### Expansion Joints

- **Spacing:** Every **20-25 feet** in running wall length (brick EXPANDS over time — opposite of CMU, which shrinks)
- **Minimum joint width:** **3/8 inch** (1/2" preferred for longer panel lengths)
- **Location:** At building corners (within 10 feet), at offsets, at openings (window/door jambs), at changes in wall height
- **Construction:** Sealant over backer rod — use silicone or STPE sealant rated for ±25% minimum movement
- **Do NOT fill expansion joints with mortar** — defeats the purpose
- **Separate from CMU control joints** — brick expansion joints and CMU control joints should be at same location in composite walls

### Shelf Angle and Flashing

- **Shelf angle:** Supports brick veneer at floor lines — typically every 3 stories (30-36 feet maximum)
- **Soft joint below shelf angle:** Minimum 3/8" sealant joint — allows floor deflection without loading brick below
- **Flashing:** Self-adhered membrane or sheet metal — continuous at every shelf angle
- **Flashing termination:** Turn up behind cavity at least 8"; extend through wall with drip edge at face
- **End dams on flashing** at terminations — prevent water running off edge into wall assembly

### Mortar Droppings Management

- **Mortar droppings in cavity are the #1 construction quality issue** — they bridge the cavity and create water paths
- **Prevention:** Use cavity drainage board or mortar-catching mesh in cavity
- **Minimum cavity width:** 1 inch clear air space (2 inches preferred for effective drainage)
- **Clean cavity at weep hole level** before covering with subsequent courses

## 7. STONE VENEER

### Anchoring Methods

| Method | Stone Thickness | Weight Limit | Application |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Mechanical anchors (kerf clips)** | 1-1/4" to 3" | 25-40 PSF | Most common for thin stone veneer on commercial buildings |
| **Adhesive-applied (thin stone)** | <1-1/4" | 15 PSF maximum | Manufactured stone veneer (cultured stone), interior |
| **Dowel and epoxy** | 2-4" | 40-60 PSF | Full-thickness stone, monumental |
| **Truss/outrigger system** | 2-6" | 60+ PSF | Thick stone, tall panels, monumental buildings |

### Key Rules

- **Stone >15 PSF requires mechanical anchoring** — adhesive alone is insufficient
- **Backup structure must be designed for stone weight** — verify structural adequacy
- **Thermal movement:** Stone moves with temperature — provide expansion joints per stone type
- **Granite:** Low movement, joints at 20-30 feet
- **Marble/limestone:** Higher movement, joints at 15-20 feet
- **Never apply stone veneer over wood framing without engineering** — deflection will crack joints

## 8. COLD WEATHER MASONRY

### TMS 602/ACI 530.1 Requirements

**Temperature Thresholds:**

| Ambient Temperature | Required Actions |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **40°F and above (rising)** | Normal operations — no special precautions |
| **40°F and falling, or 32-40°F** | Heat mixing water and sand; keep mortar above 40°F; cover walls at end of day |
| **25-32°F** | Heat mixing water and sand to 160°F max; use heated enclosures or windbreaks; insulated blankets on completed work |
| **20-25°F** | Heat materials, use heated enclosures, maintain enclosure temp above 40°F; protect for 24 hours minimum after placement |
| **Below 20°F** | All of the above; consider suspending work; protect masonry for 48 hours minimum at 40°F+ |

**Critical Rule: Do NOT lay masonry when ambient temperature is below 40°F and falling** unless you have a comprehensive cold weather protection plan.

### Heated Material Requirements

- **Mixing water:** Heat to 130-160°F (never above 160°F — flash-sets cement)
- **Sand:** Heat to thaw if frozen; keep above 40°F (use steam pipes, heated bins, or tarps over ground)
- **CMU/Brick:** Do NOT lay frozen units — thaw to above 20°F minimum; wet units must be dry before use in freezing conditions
- **Mortar temperature at placement:** 40-120°F

### Anti-Freeze Admixtures

- **Calcium chloride (CaCl2):** Limited use — maximum 2% by weight of cement; accelerates set in cold weather
- **Do NOT use CaCl2 with reinforced masonry** — causes rebar corrosion
- **Non-chloride accelerators:** Preferred for reinforced masonry — verify compatibility with mortar type
- **Anti-freeze admixtures do NOT protect against freezing** — they only accelerate set time; still must maintain temperature above 40°F

### Protection After Placement

- **Cover tops of walls** with plastic or insulated tarps at end of each day
- **24-hour minimum protection period** above 40°F for mortar to achieve initial set
- **48-hour protection** when ambient below 25°F
- **Do NOT remove protection too early** — mortar that freezes before reaching 500 PSI has permanently reduced strength

---

## 9. HOT WEATHER MASONRY

### Challenges

- **Mortar sets faster** — reduced working time, reduced bond strength if mortar skins over before unit is placed
- **CMU absorbs moisture from mortar** — dry units pull water out of mortar before cement hydrates

### Procedures

- **Wet CMU before laying (ONLY if block is absorptive):** Sprinkle with water to reduce suction; units should be damp, NOT dripping
- **Fog spray completed masonry** — light mist to slow evaporation, aid curing
- **Shorten mortar batches** — mix smaller quantities; use within 2 hours (discard at 2.5 hours regardless)
- **Shade mortar boards and mixing area** from direct sun
- **Cover completed work** at end of each day with wet burlap and plastic
- **Do NOT add excess water to compensate for fast drying** — over-watered mortar loses strength
- **Limit mortar spread:** Do not spread mortar bed more than 4 feet ahead of laying — mortar dries before unit is placed

### Temperature Limits

- **Above 100°F or 90°F with wind >8 mph:** Implement all hot weather measures
- **Above 115°F:** Consider suspending work — mortar quality difficult to maintain

---

## 10. QUALITY CONTROL

### Dimensional Tolerances (TMS 602)

| Check | Tolerance | How to Verify |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Plumb** | ±1/4" in 10 feet; ±3/8" in 20 feet | 4-foot level at every corner and every 20 feet; plumb bob for full height |
| **Level (horizontal)** | ±1/4" in 10 feet; ±1/2" in 40 feet | String line at each bond beam course |
| **Wall thickness** | ±1/4" from specified | Tape measure at top, middle, bottom |
| **Mortar joint width** | 3/8" typical (±1/8") — range 1/4" to 1/2" acceptable | Visual + ruler spot check every 10 feet |
| **Head joint alignment (running bond)** | Head joints centered ±1/2" over block below | Visual check each course |
| **Wall straightness** | ±1/4" in 10 feet | String line along face of wall |
| **Opening dimensions** | ±1/4" of specified | Tape measure at each opening |
| **Bearing elevation** | ±1/4" of specified elevation | Survey at each bearing point |

### Joint Tooling

- **Tool joints at thumbprint firmness** — press thumb into mortar; if it leaves a clean print without sticking, it's ready
- **Too early (soft mortar):** Tooling smears, doesn't compress; results in weak, porous joint
- **Too late (hard mortar):** Tool marks, doesn't seal; dark color, reduced bond
- **Tool profile:** Concave (most weather resistant), V-joint, flush, raked (least weather resistant — avoid on exterior)
- **Tool ALL joints consistently** — head joints and bed joints; inconsistent tooling is visible and indicates poor workmanship

### Pre-Construction Checklist

- [ ] CMU delivery matches spec (grade, weight class, size, finish)
- [ ] Mortar type matches spec — verify with supplier certification
- [ ] Rebar sizes and grades match structural drawings
- [ ] Grout mix design approved — prism test schedule established
- [ ] Control joint locations laid out per drawings
- [ ] First course dry-laid to verify layout, openings, and control joint positions
- [ ] Sample panel built and approved (if architectural finish required)
- [ ] Flashing and weep hole materials on site
- [ ] Scaffold setup allows access for inspection on both faces of wall

---

## 11. COMMON DEFECTS AND DIAGNOSIS

### Efflorescence

- **What:** White crystalline salt deposits on masonry surface
- **Cause:** Water migrating through masonry dissolves soluble salts, deposits them on the surface as it evaporates
- **Prevention:** Use low-alkali cement, proper flashing and drainage, weep holes open, integral water repellent
- **Repair:** Dry brush first attempt; if persistent, wash with dilute muriatic acid (1:10 ratio), neutralize, rinse thoroughly
- **Not a structural problem** — primarily aesthetic, but indicates water is entering the wall system

### Cracking Patterns

| Crack Pattern | Likely Cause | Action |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| **Stair-step cracks at mortar joints** | Differential settlement | Notify engineer — foundation issue |
| **Vertical crack at mid-wall** | Shrinkage (CMU), missing control joint | Install control joint if possible; monitor |
| **Horizontal crack at floor line** | Shelf angle deflection, floor slab shrinkage | Verify soft joint below shelf angle |
| **Diagonal crack from corner of opening** | Stress concentration, missing lintel | Verify lintel and bearing; notify engineer |
| **Random cracking throughout** | Thermal cycling, inadequate joint reinforcement | Retrofit joint reinforcement where possible |

### Mortar Joint Deterioration

- **Premature deterioration:** Usually caused by under-tooled joints, excessive water in mix, or freezing before set
- **Repair:** Repoint (rake out deteriorated mortar 3/4" minimum, install new mortar matching type and color)
- **Match existing:** Use colored mortar sample to match — cure sample 28 days before comparing (mortar lightens as it cures)

---

## 12. CONTROL JOINTS IN CMU

### Why Needed

CMU **shrinks** over time (0.02-0.05% moisture shrinkage) — control joints provide a plane of weakness where shrinkage cracking can occur in a controlled, straight line rather than randomly.

### Spacing Rules

- **Maximum spacing:** 25 feet on center, or 1.5x wall height, whichever is less
- **At openings:** Within 4 feet of each side of window/door openings (or at jamb)
- **At changes:** Where wall height changes, at pilasters, at intersections with different wall materials
- **At building corners:** Within 10-12 feet of corner (never AT the corner — stress concentration)

### Construction

- **Sash block or special control joint block** at joint location — provides straight, clean break line
- **No mortar in control joint** — vertical joint left open
- **Backer rod + sealant** on exterior face — weather seal while allowing movement
- **Joint reinforcement must be discontinued** at control joints — do NOT run joint reinforcement through control joint
- **Structural reinforcement may cross** control joint (verify with engineer — typically a greased dowel sleeve)

---

## 13. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS

### Required for Each Masonry Section

- **Material certifications:** CMU (ASTM C90), mortar (ASTM C270), grout (ASTM C476), rebar (ASTM A615)
- **Mortar proportions** — verified on site, batch records if project requires
- **Grout placement log:** Date, location, cells grouted, grout batch, pour height, consolidation method
- **Prism test results:** 28-day f'm values linked to wall locations
- **Rebar inspection records:** Bar sizes, locations, lap lengths — signed by inspector before grouting
- **Cold/hot weather logs:** Temperature readings (ambient and mortar), protection measures used, duration of protection
- **Photos:** Critical stages — rebar before grout, flashing installation, cleanouts, wall tie installation, completed sample panel
