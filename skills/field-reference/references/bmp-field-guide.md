# BMP and Erosion Control Field Guide
## Stormwater Best Management Practices & SWPPP Requirements

---

## 1. SILT FENCE INSTALLATION

### Core Dimensions & Specs
- **Post spacing:** 6-8 feet maximum
  - Steel posts: minimum 24" deep, driven in secure
  - Wood posts: 18" minimum, 4×4 preferred for durability
- **Fabric specifications:**
  - Minimum 36" wide (top edge)
  - Non-woven geotextile, minimum 3 oz/sq yd
  - Must be porous (allows water through)
- **Installation depth:**
  - Trench: 6-8" minimum depth
  - Fabric laid flat in trench bottom
  - Backfill and compact soil (no gaps at trench line)
  - No wrinkles or voids (water will find them)

### Placement Rules
- **Orientation:** Along contour (parallel to slope)
  - NEVER install downslope (water bypasses at ends)
  - Turn ends uphill to catch lateral flow
- **Maximum upstream length:** 100 feet of slope drains to fence
  - If longer: install multiple parallel fences
- **Maximum ponding height:** 18 inches
  - Exceeding this means underflow or overtopping

### Maintenance Triggers
- **Sediment removal:** When buildup reaches 1/3 of fence height
  - For 36" fence: clean when sediment reaches 12" height
  - Remove sediment and stockpile away from fence
- **Fabric inspection:** After each rain, check for tearing or displacement
- **Repair:** Replace torn fabric section immediately
- **Removal:** Only after area is permanently stabilized AND vegetated or paved

## 2. STRAW WATTLE / FIBER ROLL

### Standard Specifications
- **Diameter:** Typically 9-12 inches
- **Length:** Supplied in 25-50 ft rolls, cut to length
- **Material:** Biodegradable coconut or straw fiber
- **Staking:**
  - Wood stakes at 3-4 foot intervals
  - Driven through wattle into soil (minimum 12" stake length)
  - Driven all the way through for stability

### Placement & Installation
- **Orientation:** Along contour, like silt fence
- **End treatment:** Turn uphill at edges
- **Joint overlap:** Minimum 6 inches (nest the rolls)
- **Burial:** Partially bury bottom 2-3 inches (not full burial like silt fence)

### Where to Use Wattle
- Supplement to silt fence on steeper slopes (2:1 or steeper)
- Concentrated flow areas (drainage swales)
- Inlet protection (around catch basin)
- Slope drains under construction (downspout outlets)
- Stabilization of slope toes

### Maintenance & Replacement
- **Inspect after rain:** Verify stakes still driven and alignment correct
- **Replace when:** Sediment fills 50% of wattle volume
  - Wattle will break down naturally (biodegradable)
  - Removes itself once vegetation establishes
- **Typical life:** 6-12 months depending on rainfall and degradation rate

## 3. INLET PROTECTION

### Critical Rule
**Always secondary control** — inlet protection alone is NOT sufficient. Must have upstream BMPs (silt fence, stabilized entrance, etc.) to reduce sediment load entering inlet.

### Four Common Methods

**A. Silt Sack (Most Common)**
- Drain insert liner (geotextile bag)
- Sits inside catch basin opening
- Water flows through fabric, sediment trapped
- Advantage: easy to install and replace
- Disadvantage: clogs faster in high-sediment areas

**B. Gravel Bag Dam**
- Sandbags stacked around basin perimeter
- Creates small berm (3-6" high)
- Must leave weep holes to allow water through
- Sediment settles in barrier zone

**C. Geotextile Wrap**
- Fabric wrapped around inlet
- Secured with tape or pins
- Water passes through; sediment stopped
- Works best on inlet boxes (not grates)

**D. Block & Gravel**
- Concrete blocks staged around inlet
- 2-3" clean gravel bed inside block perimeter
- Spreads water flow, slows entry
- Sediment settles in gravel; gravel is replaceable

### Maintenance Schedule
- **Inspect:** After every rainfall event
- **Clean when:** 50% sediment accumulation in device
- **Remove:** Sediment and dispose properly (never back to site)
- **CRITICAL:** Never completely block inlet (must allow some flow during large storms)
  - Blocked inlet = ponding + overflow across project = violation

---

## 4. STABILIZED CONSTRUCTION ENTRANCE

### Required Dimensions
- **Length:** 50 feet minimum (some jurisdictions: 100 feet — **CHECK LOCAL**)
- **Width:** 12-15 feet (must accommodate truck bed width + overhang)
- **Depth:** 6-8 inches of compacted stone
- **Material:** 2-3 inch clean crushed stone / coarse aggregate (no fines)

### Installation
- **Base preparation:** Remove vegetation, level ground
- **Geotextile fabric:** Recommended underneath (prevents stone settling into soft soil)
- **Compaction:** Roller compact stone in lifts
- **Optional additions:**
  - Rumble strips (spaced dividers; truck tires tumble off sediment)
  - Cattle guard (metal grate; heavier equipment)
  - Sweeping area (extension paved or graveled for wheel cleaning)

### Maintenance
- **Add stone regularly:** Replacing displaced aggregate
- **Street cleaning:** Remove all tracked sediment from paved road (sweep or vacuum daily if heavy traffic)
- **Inspect surface:** Stone should be firm; replace soft or muddy areas
- **Winter:** May need more frequent cleaning (moisture + freeze-thaw)

### Common Sizing Errors
- Too narrow: sediment tracked outside entrance width
- Too shallow: stone sinks into mud after first heavy rain
- Wrong material: using sand/fines (fines track onto street)
- Poor compaction: washboard surface after week 1

## 5. CONCRETE WASHOUT

### Mandatory Requirement
**Required on ALL projects with concrete work** — no exceptions. Violating this is a primary SWPPP violation.

### Containment Options
- **Lined pit:** Excavated area lined with 10 mil polyethylene minimum
  - Depth: 3-4 feet (prevents escape)
  - Outlet: lined drain to sediment chamber or pump-out
- **Prefab container:** Commercial washout tank (approved by many contractors)
  - Typically 300-500 gallons
  - Double-walled containment
  - Drain with valve (closed when not in use)
- **Bermed area:** Berm raised 1-2 feet with clay-lined bottom
  - Less preferred (leak risk); requires more oversight

### Minimum Capacity
- **Daily volume calculation:** 10% of anticipated daily concrete volume
- **Example:** 10 cubic yards ordered = 1 cubic yard (270 gallons) minimum washout capacity
- If washout undersized: overflow occurs, becomes violation

### Location Requirements
- **Minimum 50 feet from:**
  - Storm drain inlets
  - Waterbodies (creeks, ponds, wetlands)
  - Ditches or catch basins
- **Visible location:** Accessible to concrete truck driver
- **Flat terrain:** Avoid high point on site (gravity drainage)

### Signage & Labeling
- **Required sign:** "CONCRETE WASHOUT" with arrow/pointing direction
- **No dumping:** Mark other areas clearly
- **Valve lock:** Keep drain valve closed and padlocked (prevent inadvertent spillage)

### Maintenance
- **Monitor water level:** Pump or remove hardened concrete before 75% full
- **Sediment hardening:** Concrete will set — remove before concrete fully cures (easier than removing rock-hard mass later)
- **End of project:** Excavate and properly dispose of all washout material (typically goes to construction waste facility)

## 6. EROSION CONTROL BY SLOPE STEEPNESS

### Flat to 3:1 (H:V) Slope
- **Minimal erosion risk**
- **Control:** Temporary seeding + hydraulic mulch or straw mulch
- **Seeding:** Apply within 14 days of final grading
- **Mulch rate:** 1.5-2 tons per acre for straw; per spec for hydraulic

### 3:1 to 2:1 Slope
- **Moderate erosion risk**
- **Control:** Erosion Control Blanket (ECB) or Turf Reinforcement Mat (TRM)
  - ECB: biodegradable (jute/coconut); lasts 6-12 months
  - TRM: more durable (polypropylene); lasts 1-3 years
  - Seeding through blanket required
- **Installation:** Stake or turf pins every 3 feet; overlap seams 3"
- **Coverage:** Must achieve 70% vegetation in 30-60 days

### 2:1 to 1.5:1 Slope
- **High erosion risk**
- **Control:** Engineered systems required
  - TRM with quality seed mix (best practice)
  - Consider slope drain (perforated pipe + filter fabric)
  - May require geotextile grid + fill if angle of repose risk
- **Installation:** Requires experienced crew (avoid cracking or shifting)

### Steeper than 1.5:1 Slope
- **Structural failure risk**
- **Control:** Structural solutions only
  - Retaining wall (if height allows)
  - Gabions (wire baskets filled with rock)
  - Shotcrete (sprayed concrete)
  - Soldier pile + lagging system
- **Recommendation:** Consult geotechnical engineer if unsure

### Temporary Seeding Standards
- **Timeline:** Apply within 14 days of final grading
- **Seed mix:** Rapid germination (annual rye preferred)
- **Rate:** Per specification (typically 60-100 lbs/acre)
- **Mulch:** Hydraulic or straw (per spec)
- **Effectiveness:** Aim for 30% cover in 2-3 weeks, 70% in 30-60 days
- **Removal:** Once permanent seeding establishes OR area paved/built

### Permanent Seeding Standards
- **Per landscape plan specifications**
- **Establishment criterion:** 70% cover (visual assessment)
- **Timeline:** Varies by season; spring/fall preferred (better moisture)
- **Maintenance:** Watering, weeding, over-seeding if needed
- **Inspection:** Must verify establishment before project close-out

---

## 7. SWPPP INSPECTION CHECKLIST

### Inspection Frequency
- **Schedule:** Every 7 calendar days (no exceptions)
- **After rainfall:** Within 24 hours of 0.25" or greater rainfall
- **Snow/ice:** Inspect after melt event (runoff volume increases)

### Required Inspections (All BMPs Every Time)
- **Silt fence:** Burial depth, sediment accumulation, fabric integrity, posts driven
- **Inlet protection:** Device present, 50% full rule, water flow observed
- **Stabilized entrance:** Stone depth, compaction, tracked sediment on road
- **Concrete washout:** Containment intact, drain valve closed, sediment level
- **Stockpile covers:** In place, secured, no water ponding on top
- **Erosion control:** Seeding coverage %, blanket integrity, stake security
- **Slope drains:** Pipe outlet protection, discharge point (not to catch basin)

### Documentation Requirements
- **Inspector name, date, time**
- **Weather conditions:** Rainfall since last inspection, current sky, temperature
- **Condition of each BMP:** Pass/Fail or visual rating (good/fair/poor)
- **Corrective actions identified:** Specific, measurable
- **Photo documentation:** Date-stamped photos of each BMP + any deficiencies
  - Deficiencies should be clearly visible in photo

### Corrective Actions
- **Timeline:** Must begin within 24 hours of identification
- **Documentation:** Record what was done, when, by whom
- **Follow-up:** Re-inspect corrected BMP within 1 week
- **Failure to correct:** Common violation (violation on top of violation)

### Record Maintenance
- **Location:** Keep inspection reports on site (accessible for AHJ review)
- **Duration:** Retain for minimum 3 years after project completion
- **Digital backup:** Take photos + upload to cloud (paper records can be lost in weather)

## 8. COMMON SWPPP VIOLATIONS & How to Avoid

### Violation #1: Silt Fence Not Buried
- **What inspectors find:** Fabric just surface-staked, not in trench
- **Why it matters:** Water flows under fabric, sediment passes through
- **How to prevent:** Insist on trench installation; supervise day 1
- **Fix:** Remove fence, install correctly (or replace with fresh material)

### Violation #2: Sediment Buildup >1/3 Height
- **What happens:** Reduced effectiveness, possible overtopping
- **Cause:** Sediment not cleaned out on schedule
- **How to prevent:** Mark fence at 1/3 height; weekly visual check
- **Fix:** Remove sediment immediately; document with photo

### Violation #3: No Concrete Washout Area
- **Consequence:** Concrete residue in storm drain = water quality violation + fine
- **How to prevent:** Establish washout BEFORE first concrete truck arrives
- **Verification:** Photo of washout area on day 1 of concrete work
- **Fix:** Immediate installation + certification (major corrective action)

### Violation #4: Tracked Sediment on Public Roads
- **Why inspectors target this:** Visible, affects neighboring property owners
- **Prevention:** Stabilized entrance wide enough, rumble strips if high traffic
- **Sweeping schedule:** Daily if heavy truck traffic
- **Fix:** Clean street, replenish entrance stone, install rumble strips if repeated

### Violation #5: Unstabilized Stockpiles (No Perimeter Control)
- **Requirement:** All soil/aggregate stockpiles must have perimeter control
- **Acceptable:** Silt fence or wattle around all sides
- **Also required:** Cover or tackifier (prevents wind erosion)
- **Exemption:** None (even temporary piles)

### Violation #6: Missing or Incomplete Inspection Records
- **Red flag for inspectors:** No signed, dated inspection reports
- **Consequence:** Can't prove BMPs were maintained
- **How to prevent:** Schedule recurring reminder; same inspector each week
- **Requirement:** Legible handwriting + photos (electronic acceptable)

### Violation #7: Disturbed Areas Without Temporary Stabilization Beyond 14 Days
- **Rule:** Any disturbed area >1 acre must be temporarily seeded/stabilized within 14 days
- **Exception:** Areas with ongoing active construction (but still requires control)
- **How to prevent:** Calculate seeding date in project schedule; seed on day 10
- **Photo proof:** Dated photo of seeded area (proof of 14-day compliance)

## Quick Reference: When to Call Inspector vs. When to Fix

| Situation | Fix It | Call Inspector |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Sediment at 1/4 fence height | Remove (routine) | ✓ Document removal |
| Sediment at 2/3 fence height | URGENT remove | ✓ Document violation + fix |
| Single small fabric tear | Patch + document | ✓ If >12" or structural tear |
| Post leaning, fence intact | Reset post | ✓ Document |
| Post broken, fence down | URGENT repair | ✓ Document violation + timeline |
| Street tracked with sediment | Sweep/vacuum same day | ✓ Document + prevent repeat |
| No inspection records for 2 weeks | URGENT get inspector | - | Likely violation; fines |

## Key Takeaway
Inspection + maintenance = compliance. Skipping either one turns a compliant project into a violation. Assign one person as BMP champion; give them photo documentation tools and a checklist.
