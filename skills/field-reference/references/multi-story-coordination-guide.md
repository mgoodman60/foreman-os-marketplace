## 1. VERTICAL TRANSPORTATION DURING CONSTRUCTION

### Personnel & Material Hoists (Selection & Sizing)

**Hoist types**:

| Type | Capacity | Typical Speed | Cost/Month | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Personnel hoist (single cage)** | 8-10 persons (~1,500 lbs) | 150-200 FPM | $3,000-5,000 | Workers to/from floors |
| **Material hoist** | 2,000-5,000 lbs | 50-100 FPM | $2,500-4,000 | Materials to floors, no personnel |
| **Dual-purpose hoist** | 2,000 lbs + 6 persons | 100-150 FPM | $4,000-7,000 | Combination (shared cage) |
| **Freight elevator (permanent)** | 2,500-5,000 lbs | 100-200 FPM | $1,500/month | Installed early, multi-use |

**Sizing decision**:
- For 10-story building with 50-person crew: Minimum 2 hoists (1 personnel, 1 material), or 1 dual-purpose
- Cycle time per person (single hoist): ~3-4 minutes per trip (6 minutes round-trip)
- Daily throughput: Single hoist = ~60 trips/day = 8-10 people per person-hour (limits crew efficiency)
- Typical rule: 1 hoist per 150-200 workers; 1 hoist per 2,000 lbs/day material volume

**Placement strategy**:
- Position hoist outside building footprint (not interfering with crane swing radius)
- Anchor hoist to building columns every 2-3 floors (requires temporary connections)
- Provide landing platforms at each floor (safety requirement, 5'×8' minimum)
- Electrical supply: 208V 3-phase, 100A typical; pull dedicated circuit (do not share with other equipment)

**Cost impact**:
- Hoist rental: $60,000-100,000 for 6-month project (two hoists)
- Installation/removal: $5,000-10,000 (includes anchor bolts, platform setup)
- Electrical: $3,000-5,000
- Total vertical transport cost: ~$70,000-115,000 for project (5-8% of soft costs typical)

### Temporary Elevators (Building Core Installation)

**Building-integrated temporary elevator**:
- Install permanent elevator early (month 2-3 of construction)
- Temporary shaft enclosure (tarps, wire mesh) protects from weather
- Operational once structural core completed (typically floors 1-5 at that stage)
- Cost advantage: Eliminates hoist rental once operational
- Typical cost: $40,000-60,000 installed (includes controls, cabin, temporary enclosure)

**Benefit over hoist**:
- Faster cycles (200+ FPM vs. 100-150 hoist)
- Higher capacity (2,500-5,000 lbs vs. 2,000 typical hoist)
- Allows phased occupancy/temp power/plumbing testing during construction

**Decision point**: Consider permanent elevator installation if project >8 stories or duration >12 months (payback on hoist savings).

### Crane Selection for Multi-Story (Tower vs. Mobile)

**Tower crane** (typical for high-rise):
- Capacity: 5-15 tons at tip, 30-50 tons near base (load chart depth-dependent)
- Height: Builds with building (climbs 2-3 times per project typical)
- Radius: 120-200 feet typical
- Monthly cost: $10,000-20,000 (rental, operator, fuel)
- Lead time: 3-4 weeks order to on-site
- Advantage: Uninterrupted service once installed; covers entire site
- Limitation: Cannot move within building once installed; erection/climbing labor-intensive

**Mobile crane** (smaller projects or supplemental):
- Capacity: 20-100 tons mobile (varies by model, boom configuration)
- Radius: 80-150 feet (crane position-dependent)
- Daily rate: $500-2,000/day (vs. monthly tower rate)
- Advantage: Mobility; can reposition for different phases
- Limitation: Cannot service upper floors consistently (reach/angle limits)

**Multi-story strategy**:
- 4-6 stories: Possible with mobile crane (position carefully, multiple setups)
- 7-12 stories: Tower crane typical (one crane, building-integrated)
- >12 stories: Multiple tower cranes or climbing frame crane (internal climbing)

**Cost comparison example** (12-story building, 8-month project):
- Tower crane: $15,000/month × 8 = $120,000 (includes operator, climbing, maintenance)
- Mobile crane alternative: $1,500/day × 200 working days = $300,000+ (plus repositioning labor)
- **Tower crane more economical** for multi-story/long duration

### Crane Placement & Swing Radius Coordination

**Tower crane base location**:
- Place outside building footprint minimum (typically 20-30 feet from building corner)
- Verify swing radius clears building (allow 5-10 feet clearance to building face)
- Avoid utility conflicts (overhead power lines minimum 50' clearance, below-grade utilities marked)
- Coordinate with site logistics (material staging area, traffic flow around crane base)

**Concrete pad for crane base**:
- Size: 20'×20' minimum, 4-foot-thick reinforced concrete typical
- Bearing capacity: 10,000-15,000 PSF (verify subgrade soil capacity per geotech report)
- Cost: $15,000-25,000 (pad only, not including crane erection)
- Removal: $3,000-5,000 (saw-cut, haul to recycling)

**Lift planning & coordination**:
- Schedule major lifts (PEMB members, mechanical equipment) for early morning (steady winds, fewer site activities)
- Coordinate with weather forecaster (max wind 25 mph typical OSHA limit for lifting)
- Notify all trades of lift schedule; clear swing radius of personnel
- Require spotters at crane base and at landing locations (safety critical)

## 2. FLOOR-BY-FLOOR SEQUENCING

### Typical Cycle Times by Structural System

**Cast-in-place concrete** (post-tensioned or conventional):
- Cycle time: 7-10 days per floor typical
- Breakdown:
  - Day 1-2: Strip previous floor forms, prep/clean slab surface
  - Day 3-4: Install formwork, rebar, PT conduit
  - Day 5: Concrete pour (typically 1-2 day operation for full floor)
  - Day 6: Form removal (top form stripped, shore left in place)
  - Day 7-10: Post-tensioning, grouting, floor preparation for next lift
- Critical path: Concrete strength & cure before stripping/PT (minimum 3-5 days)
- Weather sensitivity: High (cold weather extends cycle, rain delays form removal)

**Structural steel** (bolted or welded):
- Cycle time: 3-5 days per floor typical
- Breakdown:
  - Day 1: Deliver/unload pieces to floor (crane coordination)
  - Day 2-3: Bolt assembly, temporary bracing installation
  - Day 4: Inspection, final torque verification, release for MEP/concrete follow-up
  - Day 5: Floor decking/shoring installation (allows next lift MEP work)
- Advantage: Rapid cycle; weather less restrictive
- Limitation: Trades cannot begin work until structure released by engineer (typically day 3-4)

**Precast concrete** (double-tee, hollow-core, etc.):
- Cycle time: 2-3 days per floor
- Breakdown:
  - Day 1: Precast units delivered, positioned (crane-intensive)
  - Day 2: Connections (welded/bolted), grouting joints
  - Day 3: Release for next lift; MEP rough-in begins
- Fastest structural cycle time
- Cost trade-off: High precast unit cost, minimal on-site labor savings

### Trade Stacking & Sequencing (Typical)

**General hierarchy** (order of trades by floor):

1. **Structural (lead trade)**: Cast-in-place concrete, steel, or precast installation
   - Drives schedule; all other trades wait for structure completion
   - Duration: 5-7 days typical

2. **MEP rough-in** (behind structure by 2 floors minimum):
   - Cannot begin until structure above is complete (structural coordination required)
   - Mechanical/plumbing/electrical runs installed through ceiling cavity
   - Duration: 7-10 days per floor (largest crew, most coordination challenges)

3. **Envelope & exterior closure**:
   - Exterior walls/windows installed as structure reaches roof (weather protection priority)
   - Duration: Parallel with MEP, overlapping last 3-4 floors

4. **Drywall/insulation** (follows MEP rough-in closeout):
   - Cannot begin until electrical/MEP sleeves through studs verified; wall bracing confirmed
   - Duration: 5-7 days per floor

5. **Finishes** (flooring, paint, fixtures):
   - Last sequence, after systems complete
   - Duration: 7-10 days per floor

### Trade Separation Distance (Floor Advancement)

**Typical floor separation**:
- Structure 2-3 floors ahead of MEP
- MEP 1-2 floors ahead of drywall
- Drywall 1-2 floors ahead of finishes

**Rationale**:
- Prevents trade conflicts (safety, work quality)
- Allows trades independent schedules (flexible timing, weather accommodates)
- Enables inspection/correction between phases

**Example timeline** (12-story building):
```
Week 1-2: Structure floors 1-2
Week 3-4: Structure floors 3-4; MEP begins floor 1
Week 5-6: Structure floors 5-6; MEP floors 2-3; Drywall floor 1
Week 7-8: Structure floors 7-8; MEP floors 4-5; Drywall floors 2-3; Finishes floor 1
...continues...
```

**Cost of separation**: Extra staging area needed (material must be staged by floor, height increases cost). Floor-by-floor delivery logistics increase $5,000-15,000 per project (acceptable trade-off for sequencing control).

## 3. SLAB EDGE PROTECTION & PERIMETER SAFETY

### Guardrails, Netting, Cable Systems

**Full-perimeter guardrail** (OSHA 1926.500):
- Height: 42" above walking surface (±2" tolerance)
- Load capacity: 200 lbs horizontal force at rail (OSHA requirement)
- Components: Mid-rail (21" below top rail), posts, kick-plate (4" high minimum)
- Material: Steel pipe (typical 1.5"-2" diameter) or engineered composite
- Cost: $15-25 per linear foot (installed)
- Installation: Install immediately after structural completion (before MEP starts)

**Netting (secondary containment)**:
- Install behind guardrail (catches falling tools, debris)
- Mesh size: 1/2" maximum openings (OSHA requirement for tool containment)
- Height: Full slab height + 2 feet minimum (extends above deck edge)
- Material: High-visibility orange/yellow nylon
- Cost: $3-5 per linear foot (material only; labor 4-8 hours per floor)
- Maintenance: Inspect daily; replace torn sections immediately

**Cable systems** (alternative to guardrails in some applications):
- Stainless steel cable (3/8" diameter typical) strung horizontally at guardrail height
- Tension: 600-800 lbs typical (maintains straight line, absorbs impact)
- Posts: Same as guardrail posts, 6' spacing typical
- Cost: $10-20 per linear foot
- Advantage: Less visual obstruction (sight lines), easier to remove/reconfigure
- Limitation: Requires higher maintenance (tension monitoring, cable wear inspection)

### Leading Edge Fall Protection (Active Work Area)

**Leading edge definition**: Area where structural members being installed extend beyond existing deck (temporary void).

**Requirement**: 100% tie-off (fall arrest system) within 6 feet of leading edge; catch platform 10-15 feet below mandatory if net not installed.

**Methods**:

1. **Catch platform** (temporary suspended platform):
   - Location: 10-15 feet below leading edge
   - Material: Plywood platform supported on steel frame (not structural deck)
   - Cost: $5,000-15,000 per platform setup (reusable, moves as construction advances)
   - Maintenance: Inspect daily; verify cables/connections

2. **Safety net system**:
   - Install during structure phase (before MEP begins)
   - Horizontal net strung 10 feet below leading edge perimeter
   - 1-inch mesh (catches personnel, tools)
   - Cost: $20,000-40,000 for full-building net (rental equipment + installation)
   - Advantage: Continuous protection; no relocation as work progresses

3. **Personal fall arrest systems** (100% tie-off):
   - Harnesses, lanyards, anchorage points installed on structural frame
   - Anchorage: Welded to steel or anchored to concrete (temporary inserts)
   - Training: All personnel working at leading edge require harness training
   - Cost: $100-200 per worker (harness purchase) + annual inspection ($50/harness)

**Field decision**: Catch platform or net system typical for large floor areas; harness backup secondary protection for specific tasks.

## 4. CONCRETE PUMPING FOR ELEVATED SLABS

### Pump Sizing by Height & Distance

**Concrete pump specifications**:

| Application | Pump Type | Capacity (CY/hr) | Max Height | Max Distance | Cost/day |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Ground-level floor** | Boom pump | 40-60 CY | 50 feet | 150 feet | $400-600 |
| **Mid-rise (5-10 floors)** | Boom pump w/lines | 40-80 CY | 120 feet | 300 feet | $600-1,000 |
| **High-rise (>10 floors)** | Line pump + manifold | 50-100 CY | 200+ feet | 400+ feet | $1,000-1,500 |
| **Remote/difficult access** | Portable pump | 20-40 CY | 80 feet | 200 feet | $300-500 |

**Sizing rule of thumb**:
- Estimate floor slab volume (SF × thickness ÷ 27 = CY)
- Example: 10,000 SF × 6" = 1,852 SF-inches = 1,852 ÷ 324 = 5.7 CY total
- If 5-hour placement window: 5.7 ÷ 5 = 1.15 CY/hour minimum pump rate
- Spec 40+ CY/hour pump (provides 3x margin for equipment variation, backup capacity)

**Boom pump vs. line pump**:
- **Boom pump**: Self-contained, articulated arm; best for accessibility, single floor
- **Line pump**: Stationary pump with hoses to hopper; best for continuous high-volume (multi-floor sequential pours)

### Pipeline Layout & Pressure Loss

**Pipeline configuration**:
- Hose diameter: Typically 4" diameter for main line (larger = lower pressure loss)
- Smaller diameter (3") used for extensions, reduces cost but increases pressure
- Total run length: Cumulative length from pump to placement point (includes vertical + horizontal + fittings)

**Pressure loss calculation**:
- Rule of thumb: ~10-15 psi loss per 100 feet of horizontal run
- Vertical: ~5 psi per floor (10 feet height)
- Example:
  - Pump to 5th floor: 50' vertical = ~25 psi
  - Plus 200' horizontal run = ~30 psi
  - Total pressure needed: ~55 psi (typical pump capacity 70-100 psi ample)

**Line flushing**:
- Before concrete pour: Pump water through line (verify pressure, test flow)
- After concrete pour: Pump water + wash water through line (prevents concrete set in lines)
- Cost: 50-100 gallons water per pump setup (~$50-100 per day)

**Field decision**: If total run >400 feet or >8 floors, consult pump operator for line sizing verification.

### Cleanup Procedures (Washout & Blockage Prevention)

**During-pour monitoring**:
- Observe concrete flow rate (should be steady, uniform)
- If flow slows/reduces, may indicate blockage forming
- Continue pumping; slowing typically indicates concrete consolidation, not blockage

**End-of-pour cleanup**:
1. **Pump washout**: Continue pumping after concrete ends, push water through (10-20 minutes typical)
2. **Line purging**: Stop water, pressurize 10-20 psi air through lines (forces water out)
3. **Return concrete & washwater to site**: Do NOT discharge to storm drain (environmental violation)
4. **Stockpile washout material**: Allowed to set, then remove as concrete waste

**Blockage prevention**:
- Keep pump running (idle concrete hardens quickly in lines)
- Do NOT wait >2 hours between concrete loads (concrete sets, blocks line)
- Retarder admixture in concrete slows set time (allows waiting if necessary)
- Cost of retarder: +$1-2/CY (worthwhile insurance against blockage)

**Field cost**: Blocked pump = $10,000+ to replace lines + 1-2 day schedule delay (critical to maintain continuous pumping).

## 5. TOWER CRANE OPERATIONS FOR MULTI-STORY

### Radius & Capacity Charts (Load Considerations)

**Load chart example** (typical tower crane, 100-ton class):

| Boom Length | Radius | Max Load | Safe Working Load |
|---|---|---|---|
| 80 feet | 50 feet | 50 tons | 35 tons (70% margin) |
| 80 feet | 100 feet | 30 tons | 20 tons |
| 120 feet | 80 feet | 25 tons | 15 tons |
| 120 feet | 150 feet | 10 tons | 6 tons |

**Interpretation**:
- At 50' radius, crane can safely lift 35 tons (chart shows 50-ton capacity; 70% safety factor reduces to usable load)
- Load diminishes with radius increase (physics: longer moment arm = reduced capacity)
- At maximum radius (150'), only 6 tons safe (lightweight materials: rebar bundles, drywall, etc.)

**Practical application**:
- PEMB members (25-40 tons) require close radius (60-80 feet typical)
- Concrete buckets (2-4 CY = 5-10 tons) operable at most radii
- Heavy equipment (MEP units, 15+ tons) must be staged carefully for radius/capacity

### Critical Picks & Multiple Crane Coordination

**Critical pick planning**:
1. **Pre-lift meeting**: Superintendent, crane operator, riggers, receiving crew discuss:
   - Load weight & center of gravity
   - Swing path (clear of personnel, overhead hazards)
   - Landing location, supporting temporary bracing
   - Weather conditions (wind speed, gusts)

2. **Lift sequence**:
   - Test lift: Lift load 3-5 feet, hold 10 seconds (verify stability, rigging integrity)
   - Slow lift to placement point (5-10 FPM typical for precision)
   - Careful lowering (final 2 feet hand-guided, spotters at landing)

3. **Rigging safety**:
   - Shackles, slings rated for load (verify certificates, no substitutions)
   - Sling angle: 60-90 degrees optimal (avoid acute angles >45 degrees = load concentration)
   - Backup rigging: Critical picks require redundant hardware (two shackles, two slings)

**Multiple crane coordination** (if two tower cranes on site):
- Establish exclusion zones (swing radii of each crane, minimum 5-foot separation)
- Color-code radii on site plan (red = crane A radius, blue = crane B)
- Communication protocol: Radio channel dedicated to crane coordination
- Schedule heavy lifts to non-overlapping times (avoid simultaneous hoisting if possible)

### Internal Climbing & Seasonal Maintenance

**Climbing sequence** (for fixed tower crane building upward):

1. **Initial erection**: Base platform set, mast sections bolted, boom installed (all ground-level)
2. **Hook to building**: At structural level ~4-5, bolt crane base to building frame (temporary connections)
3. **Climb operation**: Hydraulic climbing frame engages mast section; raises crane ~30-40 feet
4. **Add mast section**: New section inserted below upper portion; bolts tightened
5. **Repeat**: Each building level rise + climb + new section

**Climbing labor & cost**:
- Climbing service provider: $8,000-15,000 per climb (2-4 climbs typical for project)
- Schedule: Each climb takes 1-2 days (site shut down during process)
- Logistics: Requires additional mast sections staged on-site (+$20,000 inventory)

**Seasonal maintenance**:
- Monthly inspection: Bolts, cables, hydraulics (operator responsibility; included in rental)
- Annual inspection: If crane stays >12 months, NDT (non-destructive testing) required (~$3,000-5,000)
- Winter weather: Anti-icing measures if freezing temperatures expected (electrical heater for hydraulics, ~$1,000/month)

---

## 6. WEATHER IMPACTS AT HEIGHT

### Wind Speed Increase with Elevation

**Wind profile effect**: Wind speed increases with height above ground

**Typical increase factors**:
- Ground level (0-50'): Base wind speed (reference)
- 100' elevation: 1.3x base wind speed
- 150' elevation: 1.5x base wind speed
- 200'+ elevation: 1.7-2.0x base wind speed

**Example**:
- Base wind 15 mph at grade
- At 100 feet elevation: 15 × 1.3 = ~20 mph wind
- At 150 feet elevation: 15 × 1.5 = ~22 mph wind

**OSHA limits**:
- Structural steel erection: Max 25 mph sustained wind (stop work if exceeded)
- Concrete placement: Max 25 mph (wind causes plastic shrinkage cracking risk)
- Tower crane operation: Max 25 mph (safety margin; many operators shut down at 20 mph)

**Field decision**: Monitor wind speed at upper floors (not just ground weather station); wind may be unacceptable at elevation while acceptable at grade.

### Cold Weather Effects on Steel Connections

**Steel brittleness** (at low temperature):
- Impact toughness decreases as temperature drops
- Steel becomes susceptible to brittle fracture (snaps suddenly vs. bending)
- Critical threshold: Temperature <32°F (freezing)

**Cold weather restrictions**:
- Do NOT bolt steel when temperature <32°F (risk of connection failure under load)
- If ambient <32°F forecast, delay steel erection until warming
- High-strength bolts (A490) more susceptible than A325 (higher grade = slightly more brittle)

**Field practice**:
- Heated enclosures around connection areas (tarps + heater if <32°F work necessary)
- Verify ASTM specification allows cold-weather bolting (not all high-strength grades approved)
- Required PWHT (post-weld heat treatment) if welding in cold weather (adds cost, schedule delay)

**Cost impact**: Cold weather bolting restrictions may add 1-2 weeks to schedule (if winter project, plan accordingly).

### Lightning Protection During Construction

**Risk**: Upper floors/exposed steel during thunderstorms attract lightning

**Protection methods**:
1. **Temporary grounding**: Connect building steel frame to driven ground rods (temporary conductor 1/2" copper or #2/0 AWG cable)
   - Cost: $5,000-10,000 system installation
   - Maintenance: Inspect monthly, replace corroded connections

2. **Temporary lightning arrestor**: Install at building apex (rod extends above structure ~6-10 feet)
   - Cost: $2,000-3,000
   - Benefit: Provides preferential strike path (away from structural members)

3. **Weather monitoring**: Halt work when thunderstorms forecast <10 miles (typical safety protocol)
   - Evacuation procedure: All personnel off-floor within 10 minutes of lightning alert

**Field rule**: If thunder heard (audible lightning within 3-5 miles), evacuate elevated work areas immediately. Cost of work interruption << cost of lightning strike fatality (fatal injury likely if exposed on upper floors).

---

## 7. MEP COORDINATION FLOOR-BY-FLOOR

### Riser Coordination & Vertical Penetration Planning

**Mechanical riser** (HVAC distribution):
- Typical location: Interior core (minimizes ductwork run lengths)
- Space required: 8'×8' to 12'×12' per floor (varies by building size)
- Vertical expansion: Ductwork grows/shrinks with temperature; requires 1-2" clearance at floor penetrations

**Plumbing riser** (water supply, drainage):
- Hot water supply: Insulation required (2-3" foam typical; increases footprint)
- Cold water: Direct run acceptable (no insulation mandate)
- Drainage: Slope requirement 1/8" per 12 feet (affects riser layout)
- Typical space: 4'×6' riser (stacked vertically across floors)

**Electrical riser** (power distribution):
- Cable tray vs. conduit trade-off: Tray faster installation, conduit allows more routing flexibility
- Space: 3'×4' typical for power distribution
- Coordinate with fire-rated wall requirements (sleeves through rated walls require fire-stopping)

**Coordination meeting** (required weekly during rough-in phase):
- Attendees: Mechanical, plumbing, electrical, structural, general contractor
- Agenda: Review riser locations, resolve conflicts, finalize penetration schedule
- Typical conflicts:
  - Ductwork vs. beam depth (ductwork too large, conflicts with structural member)
  - Plumbing slope vs. structural floor height (sloped drain reduces clearance below, may conflict with ceiling)
  - Electrical penetrations through fire-rated walls (requires engineer approval, code-compliant fire-stopping)

**Documentation**: Riser coordination drawing (plan + section view, showing all three systems positioned conflict-free) required before framing begins.

### Sleeve Placement Before Pour (Concrete Slabs)

**Sleeve schedule** (MEP-generated document):
- Lists all penetrations by floor, location, size, pipe/duct type
- Required before concrete placement (any missed penetration requires post-pour core drilling, cost: $300-500 per hole)

**Installation procedure** (during slab formwork phase):
1. **Verify sleeve size & location** (against approved riser coordination drawing)
2. **Secure sleeve** (temporary fastening to formwork; can't shift during pour)
3. **Seal ends** (plastic caps prevent concrete from entering; removed after cure)
4. **Verify clearances** (no interference with rebar or embedded items)

**Common errors**:
- Wrong size sleeve (too small = cannot fit ductwork later, requires enlargement)
- Mislocated (per drawing it's 2 feet north, actually placed 5 feet east = useless)
- Not sealed (concrete enters sleeve, requires high-pressure water jet cleaning)

**Cost of errors**: Failed penetrations typically require core drilling (cost: $300-500 per opening, schedule delay: 2-3 days per location for drilling + cleanup).

**Field rule**: Verify sleeve schedule 48 hours before pour; final walkthrough with MEP superintendent mandatory.

### Embedded Items & Fire-Rated Penetrations

**Embedded items** (installed before concrete pour):
- Anchor bolts for equipment (mechanical units, electrical panels)
- Insert plates (for future connections, hangers)
- Sleeves for penetrations (as noted above)
- Location verification critical (embedded items cannot be relocated post-pour)

**Fire-rated penetrations**:
- If MEP penetrates fire-rated wall, requires approved firestop system (per UL listing)
- Common systems: Fire-caulk (silicone-based), fire-rated wrap, collar devices
- Installation: Typically occurs AFTER wall is closed (cannot install before drywall; blocking access)
- Cost: $50-150 per penetration (firestop materials + labor)

**Field coordination**:
- Identify all fire-rated walls in building (code requirement; typically core walls, stairwell boundaries)
- Flag on construction drawings: "Fire-rated penetrations require approved firestop system"
- Schedule firestopping during drywall phase (after MEP rough-in complete, before paint)
- Inspection required: Third-party inspector verifies firestop per UL listing

## 8. TEMPORARY BRACING & SHORING

### Reshoring Requirements (Post-Tensioned Slabs)

**Post-tensioning effect**: PT creates upward camber (slab bends upward); removal of shores too early causes sag.

**Shoring duration** (after form removal):
- **Without PT**: 24-48 hours (concrete self-supporting)
- **With PT (before stressing)**: 7-10 days minimum (concrete strength + shore support prevents sag)
- **With PT (after stressing)**: 3-5 days typical (PT camber carries load; shores can be removed earlier)

**Reshoring procedure**:
1. **Lower original shores** (don't remove; transfer load gradually to reshorable system)
2. **Install reshorable props** (temporary adjustable posts, 4'×4' timber base minimum)
3. **Adjust for floor elevation** (ensure all props support uniformly; no partial support creates weak points)
4. **Monitor deflection** (measure slab elevation daily; if sag >0.5", add props)
5. **Remove reshorable system** (after next floor structural completion, typically 5-7 days)

**Shoring loads**:
- Fresh concrete slab = full dead load (150-170 lbs/SF typical)
- By 28 days, concrete strength sufficient for self-support (with careful stripping procedure)
- Reshorable props must support full load + live load from next floor construction (200-300 lbs/SF total)

**Cost**: Temporary shoring/reshoring = 5-8% of structural concrete cost (cannot be avoided; critical safety system).

### Minimum Concrete Strength Before Stripping

**ACI 308 standard** (concrete strength for form removal):

| Element Type | Min Strength (f'c %) | Typical Age |
|---|---|---|
| **Horizontal slabs** | 50% of f'c | 3-7 days (60°F+) |
| **Vertical walls** | 50% of f'c | 24-48 hours |
| **Beams (structural) supporting load** | 75% of f'c | 7-14 days |
| **Post-tensioned slabs** | 85% of f'c (before PT stressing) | 10-14 days |

**Maturity testing** (temperature-corrected strength):
- Rather than calendar days, use maturity method (temperature history correlates to strength gain)
- Example: 60°F for 7 days vs. 40°F for 14 days may both achieve 50% strength (depending on mix design)
- Field advantage: Cold weather projects don't require extended form time if maturity test confirms strength

**Cylinder breaks** (24-hour or 7-day breaks confirm strength):
- Cast test cylinders during pour (cure same conditions as deck)
- Break cylinders at 24 hours and 7 days
- If 7-day break shows 50%+ of f'c, forms can be removed immediately (age-dependent restriction waived)
- Cost: ~$500 per break (minimal vs. scheduling delay of extended shoring)

### Multi-Level Shoring Calculations (Load Path Analysis)

**Shoring load distribution** (critical for safety):

Example: 4-story building, each slab 150 lbs/SF, under construction (concrete not yet cured to full strength).

**Load on floor 3 (under construction)**:
- Own weight: 150 lbs/SF (fresh concrete)
- Live load (workers, equipment): 100 lbs/SF
- Total: 250 lbs/SF

**Load transmitted through shores to floor 2**:
- Floor 3 load: 250 lbs/SF
- Plus floor 2 own weight: 150 lbs/SF
- Plus floor 2 construction loading: 100 lbs/SF
- Total on floor 2: 500 lbs/SF

**Load transmitted to floor 1**:
- Cumulative from floors 3 + 2 + 1: 250 + 250 + 150 = 650 lbs/SF

**Foundation/ground load**:
- All three floors: 250 + 250 + 250 + ground floor live = 750-850 lbs/SF total

**Implication**:
- Lower floors must support 3x the normal dead load during construction (stresses concrete, requires larger temporary base pads)
- Shoring design must account for cumulative load (cannot use simplified single-floor load)
- Engineer must verify shoring design by floor (typical calculation with specialty software)

**Field oversight**:
- Do NOT remove shores from lower floors until corresponding upper slab cured to full strength
- Premature shore removal causes cascading failure risk (lower slab overloaded, cracks)
- Cost of shoring engineering: $2,000-5,000 per project (required; cannot skip)

## UNIVERSAL FIELD RULES (MULTI-STORY)

1. **Vertical transport (hoists) cost is not optional; budget 5-8% of soft costs** — Inadequate hoisting creates bottlenecks, crew delays.

2. **Tower crane placement & swing radius coordination must occur before erection** — Late discovery of conflicts adds weeks to schedule.

3. **Maintain 2-3 floor separation between trades** — Insufficient separation creates daily conflicts, rework, safety hazards.

4. **Fall protection at leading edge (catch platform or net) is mandatory before structural work begins** — Do not proceed without this installed.

5. **Riser coordination drawing must be approved before any concrete pour** — Missed penetrations = expensive core drilling, schedule delay.

6. **Post-tensioned slabs require reshoring after form removal** — Removing all shores creates sag, potential structural issues.

7. **Wind speed at elevation is significantly higher than grade** — Monitor upper-floor wind; may exceed safety limits despite acceptable ground weather.

8. **Shoring loads on lower floors compound (stacking effect)** — Cannot remove lower-floor shores until all upper floors cured; cumulative load analysis required.
