# AIA Contract Forms Field Guide

## Overview

This reference provides a practical, superintendent-focused guide to the three AIA contract forms that govern most commercial construction projects: A101 (Owner-Contractor Agreement), A201 (General Conditions), and A401 (Contractor-Subcontractor Agreement). The focus is on clauses that directly affect daily field operations, with plain-language explanations and situational guidance.

This is not a legal treatise. It is a field reference so you know which clause applies when something goes sideways on your job site.

## A101 -- Owner-Contractor Agreement Quick Reference

The A101 is the deal itself: who, what, how much, by when.

### Critical Dates and Numbers

| Item | Where to Find It | Why It Matters |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| Contract Sum | Article 4 | Every dollar above this needs a signed CO |
| Date of Commencement | Article 3.1 | The clock starts here -- all schedule obligations run from this date |
| Substantial Completion Date | Article 3.3 | Miss this and liquidated damages start accruing |
| Liquidated Damages Rate | Article 3.3 (if included) | The daily cost of being late -- could be $500/day or $50,000/day |
| Retainage Percentage | Article 5.1.7 | Typically 5-10% held from each pay app until substantial completion |
| Pay App Schedule | Article 5.1 | Usually monthly, submitted by a specific day |
| Dispute Resolution | Article 6 | Arbitration or litigation -- know BEFORE you need it |

### Situations Mapped to A101 Clauses

| Situation | Relevant Clause | What to Do |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| Owner says "just go ahead with the extra work" | Art. 4 (Contract Sum) | Get written authorization. No verbal change orders. Log the request in your daily report. |
| You think substantial completion is near | Art. 3.3 + A201 9.8 | Request architect inspection for Certificate of Substantial Completion (G704). Know the definition -- owner must be able to occupy for intended use. |
| Owner wants to move into part of the building early | Art. 5 + A201 9.9 | Partial occupancy requires mutual agreement. Get it in writing. Triggers insurance and warranty questions. |
| Owner is not paying on time | Art. 5 + A201 9.7 | After 7 days past due, contractor can give 7-day written notice. If still unpaid, contractor can stop work or terminate per Art. 7. |
| Owner wants to suspend work | Art. 7.1 | Owner can suspend with 7-day written notice. Contractor entitled to cost adjustment and time extension for the suspension period. |
| You want to know if the owner can actually pay | A201 2.2 | Contractor can request reasonable evidence that owner has made financial arrangements to pay for the project. |

### What the Super Needs to Know -- A101 Callouts

**Callout 1: The Contract Sum is a ceiling, not a suggestion.**
No work beyond the Contract Sum should be performed without an approved Change Order. If someone tells you to "figure it out and we will deal with the paperwork later," that is a recipe for a constructive change order claim -- and the contractor may end up absorbing the cost.

**Callout 2: Substantial Completion vs. Final Completion -- they are different.**
Substantial Completion is when the owner can use the facility for its intended purpose, even if punch list items remain. Final Completion is when every last item is done and all documentation is submitted. Retainage release is typically tied to Substantial Completion (partial release) and Final Completion (full release). Warranty periods start at Substantial Completion.

**Callout 3: Liquidated damages are real money.**
If your contract has LDs, know the rate. On a $20M project with $2,500/day LDs, being 30 days late costs $75,000. On large public projects, LD rates of $5,000-$10,000+ per day are common. This is money deducted from your final payment -- there is no negotiation after the fact.

## A201 -- General Conditions Clause-by-Clause Field Guide

The A201 is the rule book for how the project operates. Every superintendent should know Articles 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, and 15 well enough to reference them in conversation.

### Article 3 -- Contractor Responsibilities (The Big Ones)

#### Section 3.1.1 -- "Reasonably Inferable"

**Plain language:** You have to provide everything that a reasonable contractor should have known was needed, even if it is not explicitly shown on the drawings or in the specs.

**Field example:** The drawings show a second-floor bathroom but do not detail the floor drain. A reasonable contractor knows bathrooms need floor drains. You cannot claim "it was not on the drawings" for something that is standard practice.

**What to do:** During pre-construction and throughout the project, flag anything that seems missing. Submit an RFI if you are unsure. The RFI creates a record that you raised the question -- this protects you if the missing item turns out to be a significant cost or scope issue.

#### Section 3.2 -- Review of Contract Documents

**Plain language:** You are expected to review the drawings and specs before you build. If you notice errors, conflicts, or omissions, you must report them to the architect.

**Field trap:** If you notice a conflict between the structural and architectural drawings but do not report it, you may be liable for the resulting rework. The argument is: "You saw it, you should have said something."

**What to do:** During scope review and throughout construction, submit RFIs for any conflicts, errors, or ambiguities. Document what you found and when. Do not just build whatever is shown if you know it is wrong.

#### Section 3.3 -- Means and Methods

**Plain language:** The contractor decides HOW to build. The architect decides WHAT to build. The architect cannot dictate your construction procedures, sequences, techniques, or safety measures.

**Field trap:** If the architect or owner tells you how to perform the work (crane sequence, concrete placement method, shoring approach), and you follow their direction and something goes wrong, you may still be liable because means and methods are YOUR responsibility.

**What to do:** If someone tries to dictate means and methods, acknowledge their concern, but make your own decision. If they insist, document it in writing: "Per your direction on [date], you have instructed us to [specific method]. We are proceeding under protest and reserve our rights." Then consult with your PM and safety team.

#### Section 3.5 -- Warranty

**Plain language:** All materials and workmanship must be free from defects and conform to the contract documents. This is an ongoing obligation throughout construction.

**Field impact:** If you install something and it is defective, you fix it at no cost to the owner -- even if you have already been paid for it. This warranty runs during construction AND for one year after Substantial Completion (per Section 12.2.2).

#### Section 3.7 -- Permits, Fees, and Code Compliance

**Plain language:** You get the permits, you pay the fees, you comply with codes. If the code conflicts with the drawings, you notify the architect. If you build something that violates code (even if the drawings showed it that way), you are responsible for making it code-compliant at no extra cost.

**The exception:** If the code violation is caused by the architect's design and you notified the architect of the conflict, the correction is the architect's (and therefore the owner's) responsibility.

#### Section 3.9 -- Superintendent

**Plain language:** You must be on site whenever work is being performed. You represent the contractor and are authorized to receive communications on behalf of the contractor.

**Field impact:** Anything communicated to you IS communicated to the contractor. Verbal instructions from the architect or owner delivered to you on site are legally delivered to the contractor. This is why you must document everything -- you are the contractor's eyes and ears in the field.

#### Section 3.12 -- Shop Drawings, Product Data, and Samples

**Plain language:** Contractor reviews all submittals for compliance before sending to architect. Architect's review does NOT relieve contractor of responsibility for errors in submittals.

**Common pitfall:** A sub submits a shop drawing directly to the architect without GC review. The architect approves it. Later, a conflict is discovered. The GC is still responsible because GC review was skipped. Always enforce the submittal chain.

### Article 7 -- Changes in the Work (Know This Cold)

#### The Three Ways Work Can Change

| Method | Who Signs | Cost/Time Impact | Contractor Agreement Required? |
|--------|-----------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Change Order** (7.2) | Owner, Contractor, Architect | Must be agreed upon before signing | Yes -- all parties agree |
| **Construction Change Directive** (7.3) | Owner and Architect | Cost/time determined later if not agreed | No -- contractor must proceed |
| **Minor Change** (7.4) | Architect alone | No cost or time impact | No -- but contractor can object if it actually affects cost/time |

#### Field Decision Tree -- Something Changed on My Project

```
Someone wants work done differently from the drawings
    |
    v
Is it a minor clarification with NO cost or time impact?
    |
    +---> Yes --> Architect can issue minor change in the work (7.4)
    |              BUT if you think it affects cost or time, OBJECT IN WRITING
    |
    +---> No --> Does the contractor agree on cost and time?
                  |
                  +---> Yes --> Change Order (7.2) -- all three parties sign
                  |
                  +---> No --> Construction Change Directive (7.3)
                                Owner and architect direct the change
                                Contractor MUST proceed with the work
                                Cost determined by:
                                  1. Mutual agreement (preferred)
                                  2. Unit prices in the contract
                                  3. Cost-plus (actual cost + overhead + profit)
                                  4. Architect's reasonable determination
```

**What the super needs to know:** You will get verbal directives in the field. Your immediate response should be:
1. "I understand the request. Let me confirm it in writing."
2. Send an email or formal letter confirming what was asked and by whom.
3. State: "This appears to constitute a change to the contract documents. We will proceed upon receipt of a written Change Order or Construction Change Directive."
4. If told to proceed immediately (and it is a CCD situation), proceed BUT send written notice that you are proceeding under protest on cost/time pending formal documentation.

### Article 8 -- Time (Time Is of the Essence)

**Section 8.2.1:** "Time limits stated in the Contract Documents are of the essence of the Contract."

This legal phrase means: deadlines are not guidelines, they are strict obligations. Missing a deadline is a material breach -- not just an inconvenience.

**Section 8.3:** If you are delayed by the owner, architect, or a separate contractor, you are entitled to a time extension. BUT you must:
1. Identify the delay cause and its impact on the critical path
2. Submit a written claim per Article 15 within 21 days
3. Include specific schedule analysis showing how the delay impacts completion
4. A time extension is NOT automatic -- you must ask for it properly

### Article 9 -- Payments (The Money Trail)

#### Pay App Flow

```
Contractor submits Application for Payment (G702/G703)
    |
    v (7 days)
Architect reviews and issues Certificate for Payment (G704)
    |
    v
Owner pays contractor per contract terms (typically 30 days)
    |
    v (7 days after receiving payment)
Contractor pays subcontractors (Section 9.6.2)
    |
    v
Subs pay their subs and suppliers
```

**Section 9.5 -- Reasons Architect Can Withhold Payment:**
1. Defective work not remedied
2. Third-party claims filed or reasonable evidence of likely claims
3. Failure to pay subs and suppliers
4. Reasonable evidence work cannot be completed for the unpaid balance
5. Damage to owner or other contractors
6. Persistent failure to carry out the work per contract documents
7. Failure to maintain adequate personnel and equipment

**What the super needs to know:** Your percentage complete on the Schedule of Values directly drives the pay app. If you overstate progress, you are creating a false billing. If you understate it, you are leaving money on the table. Be accurate and be able to defend your numbers with photos and field measurements.

### Article 14 -- Termination (The Nuclear Options)

#### Termination Quick Reference

| Who Terminates | Type | Required Notice | Grounds |
|---------------|------|-----------------|---------|
| Owner | For Cause (14.2) | 7 days written | Persistent failure, non-payment to subs, code violations, substantial breach |
| Owner | For Convenience (14.4) | 7 days written | Any reason -- no grounds required |
| Owner | Suspension (14.3) | 7 days written | Any reason -- temporary halt, not termination |
| Contractor | For Cause (14.1) | 7 days written | 30-day work stoppage (not contractor's fault), 60-day owner non-payment |

### Article 15 -- Claims and Disputes (The 21-Day Rule)

**The single most important deadline for field personnel:**

Claims must be initiated **within 21 days** after occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim (Section 15.1.3).

**What counts as an "event":**
- A verbal directive to perform extra work
- Discovery of a design conflict in the field
- A delay event (weather, owner action, design issue)
- Differing site conditions encountered
- Rejection of conforming work by the architect
- Interference by another contractor or the owner

**What you must do within 21 days:**
1. Identify the event and its contractual basis
2. Prepare a written notice of claim
3. Submit it to the architect (IDM) and the other party
4. Include: description of event, date, contract provisions, requested relief (time, money, or both)
5. If you cannot quantify the impact yet, state "amount to be determined pending investigation" and submit what you have

**Missing this deadline can waive the entire claim -- regardless of merit.**

## A401 -- Contractor-Subcontractor Agreement Field Guide

### Flow-Down Principle

The A401 incorporates the A201 by reference. This means every obligation the contractor has to the owner, the sub has to the contractor. Every right the contractor has under the A201, the sub has a similar right against the contractor.

**Practical impact:** When you enforce contract provisions against a sub, you are enforcing A201 requirements that flowed down through the A401.

### Key Sub Management Clauses

| Situation on Site | A401 Reference | What to Do |
|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| Sub is not providing enough workers | Art. 5 (Sub's Responsibilities) | Document in daily report. Issue written notice referencing Art. 5 and schedule requirements. |
| Sub wants more money for something | Art. 6 (Changes) | Sub must submit written claim within 21 days. No verbal claims. Direct them to their office to submit formally. |
| Sub is not paying their workers | Art. 9 + Art. 12 | Red flag for default. Document. Notify PM. Check payment bond. |
| Sub wants to stop work over payment | Art. 9.2 | Sub can demand written explanation if payment is 7+ days late (not sub's fault). If not resolved, sub can stop work after 7-day notice. |
| Sub's work is defective | A201 12.2 (via flow-down) | Direct sub to correct. Document the deficiency. If sub refuses, issue formal notice. |
| Sub is not attending meetings | Art. 5 + Art. 8 | Written notice that coordination participation is a contract requirement. Document absences. |
| Sub is violating safety rules | A201 10.1 (via flow-down) | Stop the work if imminent danger. Issue written safety violation notice. Repeated violations support termination for cause. |

### A401 Article 12 -- Termination of Sub

**Grounds for termination for cause:**
1. Failure to supply adequate workforce or materials
2. Failure to make payments to sub's own subs/suppliers
3. Disregard of laws, ordinances, rules, or regulations
4. Failure to prosecute the work diligently
5. Otherwise guilty of substantial breach of the subcontract

**Required procedure:**
1. Written notice specifying the grounds
2. 7-day period for sub to commence cure
3. Cure must be "satisfactory" and continuous
4. If cure fails, contractor may terminate

**After termination:**
- Contractor may complete the work using other means
- All excess costs are back-charged to the sub
- Sub is not entitled to further payment until work is complete
- If cost to complete exceeds remaining subcontract balance, sub owes the difference

## Common Pitfalls and Traps

### Trap 1: "The Architect Said It Was OK"
Architect approval of a submittal or verbal acceptance of work does NOT relieve the contractor of responsibility. If you install something based on architect approval and it fails, you are still responsible. The architect's review is for design conformance only.

### Trap 2: "We Already Started the Extra Work"
If you start extra work without a signed Change Order or CCD, you may not be able to recover the cost. Always get written authorization BEFORE starting. If directed to proceed immediately, send written confirmation of the directive and proceed under the CCD provisions.

### Trap 3: "The Inspector Passed It"
A passing inspection by the building official does NOT mean the work conforms to the contract documents. The architect can still reject work that passed inspection if it does not match the drawings/specs. Code compliance is the minimum; contract compliance may be higher.

### Trap 4: "The Sub's Contract Does Not Say That"
If the A201 requires something and the A401 incorporates the A201, the sub is bound by it even if the specific subcontract scope document does not mention it. The flow-down is automatic.

### Trap 5: "We Told Them Verbally"
Verbal notice does not satisfy contractual notice requirements. If the contract says "written notice," it must be written. Verbal conversations are supplementary, not primary. Always follow up verbal discussions with written confirmation.

### Trap 6: "It Is Close Enough"
"Reasonably inferable" does not mean "close enough." If the contract documents specify a particular product, substitutions require formal approval per the specifications. Installing a substitution without approval is defective work -- even if the product is "equivalent."
