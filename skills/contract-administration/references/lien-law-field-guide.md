# Mechanics Lien Law Field Guide

## Overview

Mechanics liens exist to protect people who improve real property but do not get paid. They give subs, suppliers, and laborers a legal claim against the property itself -- not just against the party who owes them money. This is powerful leverage, but it comes with strict rules, tight deadlines, and specific procedures that vary state to state.

For the superintendent, lien law matters because you manage the pay application cycle, collect lien waivers, and are the first person on site to know when someone is not getting paid. Getting the lien waiver process right protects the project. Getting it wrong exposes the owner, the GC, and the lender to claims against the property.

**Key principle:** Lien rights are statutory. They exist because the state legislature created them. Every state's lien law is different. The rules in California are not the same as Texas, which are not the same as Florida. Always verify the specific statute for your project's jurisdiction.

**Public projects exception:** Mechanics liens do NOT apply to public property (government buildings, public roads, schools). On public projects, the payment bond substitutes for lien rights. If you are on a public project, the lien waiver process still applies to the general contractor and subs (because the GC has a payment bond), but no one can file a lien against government property.

## Lien Waiver Types -- Detailed Comparison Table

| Feature | Conditional Waiver on Progress Payment | Unconditional Waiver on Progress Payment | Conditional Waiver on Final Payment | Unconditional Waiver on Final Payment |
|---------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **When signed** | With pay app submission (before payment received) | After payment is received and cleared | With final pay app submission (before final payment received) | After final payment is received and cleared |
| **Condition** | Effective ONLY if payment is actually received | No condition -- effective immediately | Effective ONLY if final payment is actually received | No condition -- effective immediately |
| **Scope** | Work through a specific date | Work through a specific date | ALL work on the project including retainage | ALL work on the project including retainage |
| **Covers retainage?** | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Risk to signer** | Low -- protected if payment not made | Medium -- waives rights even if check bounces | Low -- protected if final payment not made | High -- waives ALL rights permanently |
| **When to collect** | Every pay app cycle, from every sub | After payment clears for prior month | With final pay app only | After final payment clears |
| **Statutory form required?** | Yes, in many states | Yes, in many states | Yes, in many states | Yes, in many states |

### States Requiring Statutory Lien Waiver Forms

The following states have enacted statutory lien waiver forms. Using non-statutory forms in these states may make the waiver unenforceable:

| State | Statutory Forms Required | Key Notes |
|-------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Arizona** | Yes -- 4 statutory forms | Must use exact statutory language |
| **California** | Yes -- 4 statutory forms (Civil Code 8132-8138) | Most prescriptive in the country; non-conforming waivers are void |
| **Georgia** | Yes -- 4 statutory forms | Must use statutory language; non-conforming waivers invalid |
| **Michigan** | Yes -- specific statutory language required | Waivers must substantially comply with statutory form |
| **Mississippi** | Yes -- statutory forms provided | Must follow statutory requirements |
| **Missouri** | Yes -- specific statutory forms | Non-conforming waivers may be unenforceable |
| **Montana** | Yes -- statutory forms | Must comply with statutory language |
| **Nevada** | Yes -- 4 statutory forms | Strict compliance required |
| **Texas** | Yes -- specific statutory language | Must comply with Property Code requirements |
| **Utah** | Yes -- 4 statutory forms | Non-conforming waivers void |
| **Wisconsin** | Yes -- statutory notice language | Must include specific statutory language |
| **Wyoming** | Yes -- statutory form language | Must substantially comply |

**Field rule:** If your project is in one of these states, use the exact statutory forms. Do not modify them, do not use your company's "standard" waiver form, and do not accept non-statutory forms from subs. When in doubt, ask your PM or corporate counsel for the correct form.

For states without statutory forms, the four standard types still apply, but you have more flexibility in the form used. Many companies and title companies have developed standard forms that are widely accepted.

## Filing Deadline Ranges by State -- General Guidance

These are approximate ranges to illustrate how widely deadlines vary. ALWAYS verify the specific statute for your project state. A single day's error can extinguish lien rights entirely.

### Preliminary Notice Deadlines

| State Group | Preliminary Notice Deadline | States (Examples) |
|------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **No preliminary notice required** | N/A -- lien can be filed without prior notice | Many eastern states: NY, NJ, PA, MA, CT, VA, MD, OH, IL |
| **20 days from first furnishing** | 20 calendar days | California, Nevada, Arizona |
| **30 days from first furnishing** | 30 calendar days | Washington, Oregon, Montana |
| **45 days from first furnishing** | 45 calendar days | Michigan |
| **Within specific time of each month's work** | Varies -- monthly notice required | Some states require notice for each payment period |
| **Before or at start of work** | Before commencing work | A few states require notice before starting |

**Who must send preliminary notice:**
- Generally required from subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, and suppliers who do not have a direct contract with the property owner
- First-tier subs with direct GC contract: required in some states, not others
- GCs with direct owner contract: generally not required (the owner knows who they hired)

### Lien Filing Deadlines (After Last Furnishing Labor/Materials)

| Deadline Range | States (Examples) |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **60 days** | Indiana (subcontractors), Kentucky |
| **75 days** | Michigan |
| **90 days** | California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New York, Oregon, Washington |
| **120 days** | Arizona, Georgia, Texas, Virginia |
| **150 days** | Connecticut |
| **180 days** | Tennessee, Missouri (some claimants) |
| **6-12 months** | A few states with longer filing periods |

### Lien Enforcement Deadlines (After Filing Lien)

| Enforcement Deadline | States (Examples) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| **90 days** | Florida (if owner files notice of contest) |
| **6 months** | California, Oregon, Washington |
| **1 year** | Many states including AZ, CO, GA, IL, MI, TX, VA |
| **2 years** | A few states |

**What happens if enforcement deadline passes:** The lien expires. It is as if it was never filed. The property is cleared. The claimant may still have a breach of contract claim, but the security of the lien against the property is gone.

## Preliminary Notice Requirements -- Detailed Guide

### What a Preliminary Notice Is

A preliminary notice (also called preliminary lien notice, pre-lien notice, notice to owner, or notice of furnishing) is a document sent to the property owner (and sometimes the GC and lender) informing them that a particular party is furnishing labor, materials, or services to the project.

It is NOT a lien. It is NOT a threat. It is a notification that preserves the sender's right to file a lien later if they are not paid.

### Why Preliminary Notices Show Up on Your Job Site

As superintendent, you may receive preliminary notices addressed to the owner or GC. This is normal and expected.

**What to do when you receive one:**

1. **Do not ignore it** -- This is a legal document with implications
2. **Log it immediately** -- Date received, sender name, sender address, claimed amount (if stated), project description
3. **Forward copies** to your PM, accounting department, and the owner (if addressed to the owner)
4. **Compare against your sub list** -- Is this a known sub or supplier? If not, who hired them?
5. **Verify legitimacy** -- Is this party actually furnishing to your project? Sometimes notices are sent in error or by parties on adjacent projects
6. **Do NOT respond with any payment or waiver** -- That is an accounting/PM function

### Preliminary Notice Tracking Log

Maintain a log of all preliminary notices received:

| Date Received | Sender | Sender Address | Claimed Amount | Sub They Work For | Verified on Project? | Forwarded to PM/Acct? | Notes |
|--------------|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|
| | | | | | Yes / No / Unknown | Yes / No | |

## Lien Waiver Exchange Process Tied to Pay App Cycle

### Monthly Pay App Lien Waiver Flow

This is the standard flow for each monthly pay application cycle. The superintendent coordinates the collection; the PM and accounting verify and process.

```
Day 1 of Billing Period (e.g., 1st of month)
    |
    v
Sub works during billing period
    |
    v
Billing Cutoff Date (e.g., 25th of month)
    |
    v
Sub submits pay application to GC
  - Includes: Schedule of Values update, backup documentation
  - Includes: CONDITIONAL Waiver on Progress Payment (for current month's billing)
  - Includes: UNCONDITIONAL Waiver on Progress Payment (for PRIOR month -- proves they got paid)
    |
    v
Super verifies work in place matches pay app quantities
    |
    v
GC reviews and certifies pay app package
  - Verifies all lien waivers received and complete
  - Checks waiver amounts match pay app amounts
  - Confirms unconditional waivers match prior month's payment
    |
    v
GC submits certified pay app to Architect (AIA) or Owner
    |
    v
Architect certifies payment (7 days per A201)
    |
    v
Owner pays GC (per contract terms, typically 30 days)
    |
    v
GC pays sub (within 7 days of receiving owner payment per A201 9.6.2)
    |
    v
Cycle repeats next month
  - Sub provides Unconditional Waiver for the payment just received
  - Sub provides Conditional Waiver for new billing
```

### Final Payment Lien Waiver Flow

```
Sub completes all work (including punch list corrections)
    |
    v
Sub submits FINAL pay application
  - Includes: Final Schedule of Values (100% complete)
  - Includes: CONDITIONAL Waiver on Final Payment (covers everything including retainage)
  - Includes: UNCONDITIONAL Waiver on Progress Payment (for last month's regular payment)
    |
    v
GC verifies:
  - All work complete and accepted
  - All punch list items resolved
  - All submittals, O&M manuals, warranties, as-builts submitted
  - All lien waivers for the entire project received and verified
  - Sub-tier lien waivers collected (from sub's subs and suppliers)
    |
    v
GC certifies final pay app and submits to Architect/Owner
    |
    v
Owner makes final payment (including retainage release)
    |
    v
GC pays sub final payment (including retainage)
    |
    v
Sub provides UNCONDITIONAL Waiver on Final Payment
  - This is the LAST document in the chain
  - Signed ONLY after final payment has been received and cleared
  - Covers ALL work, ALL materials, ALL retainage
  - This is permanent and irreversible
```

### Sub-Tier Lien Waiver Collection

For large subcontract scopes, the GC should also collect lien waivers from the sub's major sub-subcontractors and suppliers. These are the parties most likely to file liens if the sub does not pay them.

**Which sub-tier parties to track:**

| Sub-Tier Party | When to Track | Dollar Threshold |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Major material suppliers | Always | Suppliers providing $25,000+ in materials |
| Sub-subcontractors | Always on scopes > $100K | Any sub-sub with scope > $10,000 |
| Equipment rental companies | If significant rental costs | Rentals exceeding $10,000 |
| Labor brokers/staffing agencies | If sub uses staffing agencies | Any amount -- labor liens are high-priority |
| Specialty material fabricators | If custom fabrication involved | Any amount for custom-fabricated items |

**How to collect sub-tier waivers:**
1. Require the prime sub to provide sub-tier waiver list at project start
2. Include sub-tier waiver requirement in the subcontract
3. Collect sub-tier conditional waivers with each pay app
4. Collect sub-tier unconditional waivers with the following month's pay app
5. Collect sub-tier final waivers before releasing sub's final payment/retainage

## Common Mistakes That Invalidate Lien Rights

### Mistake 1: Missing the Preliminary Notice Deadline

**What happens:** In states requiring preliminary notice, failure to send it within the deadline (typically 20-45 days from first furnishing) extinguishes the right to file a mechanics lien entirely.

**Who is at risk:** Sub-subcontractors and suppliers who do not have a direct contract with the owner.

**How to prevent:** Calendar the preliminary notice deadline from Day 1 on every project. Make it part of the mobilization checklist.

### Mistake 2: Missing the Lien Filing Deadline

**What happens:** Failing to file the lien within the statutory deadline (60-180 days after last furnishing, depending on state) means the lien right is gone. The claimant may still have a breach of contract claim, but the powerful lien remedy is lost.

**Who is at risk:** Any unpaid party who waits too long to act.

**How to prevent:** Track the last date of furnishing for every sub. When payment disputes arise, flag the lien filing deadline immediately.

### Mistake 3: Signing Unconditional Waivers Before Receiving Payment

**What happens:** The signer permanently waives lien rights for the specified work/amount. If the payment never comes (check bounces, payment held, payment disputed), the signer has no lien remedy.

**Who is at risk:** Subs pressured to sign unconditional waivers as a condition of receiving payment.

**How to prevent:** Never require a sub to sign an unconditional waiver BEFORE receiving payment. The correct sequence is: conditional waiver first (with pay app), unconditional waiver later (after payment received). If your company's payment process requires unconditional waivers upfront, escalate to your PM -- this practice creates legal risk for the subs and ethical issues for the GC.

### Mistake 4: Using Non-Statutory Forms in Statutory States

**What happens:** The waiver may be unenforceable. The sub who signed it may retain their lien rights despite having signed a waiver.

**Who is at risk:** The GC and owner, who think they have waiver protection but do not.

**How to prevent:** Use the state's statutory form. Period. Do not modify it. Do not substitute your company's standard form.

### Mistake 5: Waiver Amount Does Not Match Payment Amount

**What happens:** Ambiguity about what was waived. If the waiver says $50,000 but the payment was $45,000, the sub may argue the waiver only covers $45,000. Or worse, the sub may argue the entire waiver is defective.

**Who is at risk:** Both parties -- ambiguity creates disputes.

**How to prevent:** Match waiver amounts to pay app amounts exactly. If there are deductions, back-charges, or adjustments, the waiver amount should reflect the net payment.

### Mistake 6: Not Collecting Sub-Tier Waivers

**What happens:** The GC collects waivers from the prime sub, but the prime sub is not paying their suppliers. A supplier files a lien against the project. The GC has no waiver from the supplier.

**Who is at risk:** The owner and GC -- the property now has a lien.

**How to prevent:** Require sub-tier waivers for all significant sub-tier parties (see sub-tier tracking section above).

### Mistake 7: Confusing Lien Rights with Bond Rights on Public Projects

**What happens:** On a public project, someone tries to file a mechanics lien against government property. It does not work -- you cannot lien public property. The correct remedy is a payment bond claim.

**Who is at risk:** Subs and suppliers who pursue the wrong remedy and miss the payment bond claim deadline while trying to file a lien.

**How to prevent:** Know whether your project is public or private from Day 1. On public projects, the payment bond is the remedy. On private projects, the mechanics lien is the remedy (payment bond may also be available if required by contract).

### Mistake 8: "Last Furnishing" Manipulation

**What happens:** A party sends a token worker or delivery to the site to extend their "last date of furnishing" and keep their lien filing window open. Courts generally see through this, and intentional manipulation may be rejected.

**Who is at risk:** The party attempting the manipulation -- courts may invalidate the lien.

**How to prevent:** Document actual work performed by all parties daily. Your daily reports are evidence of when parties actually performed (or did not perform) work.

| Final Waiver Status | Not due / Conditional received / Unconditional received | At closeout |

---

## Special Situations

### Situation 1: Sub Refuses to Sign Lien Waiver

**What is happening:** Sub will not sign the conditional waiver because they dispute the pay app amount, or they will not sign the unconditional waiver because they claim they were not paid correctly.

**What to do:**
1. Do not withhold payment solely because a waiver was not signed (check your jurisdiction -- some states prohibit this)
2. Document the refusal in writing
3. Ask the sub to specify their objection in writing
4. Escalate to PM and accounting
5. Consider a joint check arrangement if the dispute involves sub-tier parties
6. If the dispute cannot be resolved, consult with corporate counsel about proceeding with or without the waiver

### Situation 2: Sub-Tier Party Files a Lien

**What is happening:** A supplier or sub-sub files a mechanics lien against the project even though the GC has been paying the prime sub.

**What to do:**
1. Review the lien claim for validity (correct property, correct claimant, timely filed)
2. Check if preliminary notice was received (in states requiring it)
3. Review the prime sub's payment status and sub-tier waivers
4. Notify the owner and lender immediately
5. Demand that the prime sub resolve the lien (per subcontract indemnification provisions)
6. Consider withholding future payments to the prime sub in the amount of the lien (check contract and state law provisions)
7. If the project has a payment bond, the lien claimant may also pursue a bond claim

### Situation 3: Owner or Lender Demands "Clean" Lien Waivers Before Funding

**What is happening:** The construction lender will not fund the next draw unless all lien waivers are current and complete.

**What to do:**
1. Run the waiver tracking dashboard -- identify all gaps
2. Contact delinquent subs immediately with specific waiver requests
3. If a sub cannot provide an unconditional waiver because they have not been paid, this is a cash flow issue -- escalate to PM
4. Provide the lender with the complete waiver package for all subs who are current
5. Explain any gaps with a written explanation and timeline for resolution
6. On OCIP/CCIP projects, the wrap-up administrator may also need waiver verification
