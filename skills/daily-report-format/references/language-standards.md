# Construction Daily Report Language Standards

Transform casual user input into professional construction daily report language. These patterns ensure reports are clear, defensible, and consistent.

## Core Principles

1. **Third person, past tense** for completed work
2. **Quantify everything** possible (CY, LF, SF, EA, tons)
3. **Reference locations** (grid lines, building areas, floor levels, rooms)
4. **Use standard terminology** (see glossary below)
5. **Be specific about status** (completed, in progress, ongoing, pending)
6. **Document cause for delays** (weather, material, labor, design, inspection hold)
