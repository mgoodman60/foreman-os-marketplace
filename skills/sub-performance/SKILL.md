# Subcontractor Performance Scorecard Skill for Foreman OS

## Overview

The sub-performance skill delivers objective, data-driven performance scorecards for every subcontractor on a project. Rather than relying on gut feelings or anecdotal feedback, scorecards aggregate actual project data across five critical performance dimensions, each scored 1-10 and weighted to produce a composite score.

### Purpose

Subcontractor performance scorecards enable:

1. **Informed Bidding Decisions**: When planning the next project, access historical performance data. Prefer subs with proven track records; avoid repeat problems.
2. **Back-Charge Documentation**: Performance data (quality failures, schedule misses, safety incidents) provides objective justification for back charges or warranty claims.
3. **Performance Improvement Conversations**: Instead of vague feedback ("Your crew wasn't organized"), use data: "Your PPC was 62% this quarter; the project average is 78%. Let's discuss what blocked your work."
4. **Contract Incentives**: Reward high-performing subs (9-10 rating) with priority on future bids, multi-project discounts, or bonus incentives.
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Flag at-risk subs (<5.0 rating) early; initiate corrective action meetings or contract review before problems cascade.
6. **Preferred Vendor Lists**: Build institutional memory across projects. Track sub performance over years; promote reliable, professional subs; deprioritize problematic ones.

### Scorecard Philosophy

The sub-performance scorecard is **objective, data-driven, and fair**. It:

- Pulls data automatically from daily reports, inspections, safety logs, and RFI records (not manual opinions)
- Uses transparent scoring criteria so subs understand what they're measured on
- Separates factors within a sub's control (quality, responsiveness, professionalism) from external factors (weather delays, supplier issues)
- Generates dialogue: "Your score is 6.8. Here's where you excelled and where you can improve."

## The Five Scoring Dimensions

Each dimension is scored 1-10, measured against objective criteria, and weighted in a composite formula.

### 1. Schedule Adherence (25% Weight)

**Definition**: Does the subcontractor complete committed work on time, maintain promised crew size, mobilize/demobilize on schedule, and hit project milestones?

#### Scoring Criteria

**90%+ PPC (Percent Plan Complete) = 10**
- Subcontractor completes commitments more than 90% of the time
- Minimal incomplete work; when incomplete, root cause is external (weather, owner delay, supplier)
- Crew size consistent with promises
- Mobilization on time; demobilization efficient

**80-89% PPC = 8**
- Subcontractor completes commitments 80-89% of the time
- Good reliability; occasional incomplete work (5-10 items per season)
- Crew size generally consistent
- Minor delays in mobilization/demobilization

**70-79% PPC = 6**
- Subcontractor completes commitments 70-79% of the time
- Marginal; noticeable delays and scope deferrals
- Crew size inconsistency (promised 4, shows 2-3)
- Mobilization delays or early demobilization without notice

**60-69% PPC = 4**
- Subcontractor completes commitments 60-69% of the time
- Poor; significant schedule impact on downstream trades
- Chronic crew size shortages or absences
- Frequent mobilization/demobilization issues

**<60% PPC = 2**
- Subcontractor completes commitments fewer than 60% of the time
- Unacceptable; project delays directly attributable to this sub
- Crew unavailable, undersized, or uncooperative
- Critical schedule milestones missed

#### Data Sources

- **PPC by Trade** from last-planner skill (calculated weekly)
- **Crew Counts** from daily reports (promised vs. actual headcount)
- **Milestone Dates** from schedule vs. actual completion dates
- **Mobilization/Demobilization Dates** from contract documents vs. field records

#### Calculation

```
Schedule Score = PPC × 1.0 (primary), adjusted ±0.5 for crew consistency and milestone performance
```

**Example (MOSC):**
- Walker Construction: PPC 87%, crew consistent, early mobilization = 8.5 → Score: 8 (round down)
- W Principles (Concrete): PPC 71%, crew undersized last 2 weeks, stem wall pour delayed 1 week = 6 → Score: 6

### 2. Quality (25% Weight)

**Definition**: Does the subcontractor produce work that passes inspection on first attempt, minimize punch list items, avoid rework, and maintain warranty standards?

#### Scoring Criteria

**First-Pass Inspection Rate (FPIR) 95%+ = 10**
- 95% or more of the sub's work passes inspection without corrections
- Punch list items <5 per 1,000 SF of work
- Rework frequency <2% of total work
- Post-completion warranty callbacks zero or minimal

**FPIR 90-94% = 8**
- 90-94% of work passes first inspection
- Punch list items 5-10 per 1,000 SF
- Rework frequency 2-3%
- Few warranty callbacks

**FPIR 85-89% = 6**
- 85-89% of work passes first inspection
- Punch list items 10-20 per 1,000 SF
- Rework frequency 3-5%
- Occasional warranty callbacks

**FPIR 80-84% = 4**
- 80-84% of work passes first inspection
- Punch list items 20-40 per 1,000 SF
- Rework frequency 5-8%
- Multiple warranty callbacks

**<80% FPIR = 2**
- Fewer than 80% pass first inspection
- Punch list items >40 per 1,000 SF
- Rework frequency >8%
- Recurring warranty failures

#### Data Sources

- **Inspection Tracker** from quality-management skill (pass/fail rates by trade, by phase)
- **Punch List Items** from punch-list skill (filtered by responsible trade)
- **Rework Log** from quality-management or daily-report-format (completed rework tasks)
- **Warranty Callback Records** from closeout and post-completion phase

#### Calculation

```
Quality Score = (FPIR base 1-10) + (Punch list adjustment ±1) + (Rework adjustment ±1) + (Warranty adjustment ±0.5)
```

**Example (MOSC):**
- EKD (CFS Framing/Drywall): FPIR 91%, punch list 8/1000 SF, rework 2%, zero callbacks = 8 + 0 + 0 + 0.5 = 8.5 → Score: 8
- Stidham Cabinets: FPIR 87%, punch list 15/1000 SF, rework 4%, 1 callback = 6 + 0 + (-0.5) + 0 = 5.5 → Score: 6

### 3. Safety (20% Weight)

**Definition**: Does the subcontractor maintain a safe worksite, train crews on safety procedures, comply with PPE and housekeeping standards, and avoid incidents?

#### Scoring Criteria

- PPE compliance 80-90% (repeated reminders needed)
- Certifications current but minimal training beyond requirements

**Serious Incidents or Chronic Non-Compliance = 1**
- Multiple recordable incidents (2+) or serious incident (hospitalization, lost-time injury)
- Chronic near-misses (6+) suggesting systemic safety culture problem
- Toolbox talk attendance <80%
- Poor housekeeping (chronic debris, tripping hazards, blocked exits)

- Repeated violations after formal notice

#### Data Sources

- **Safety Management Records** from safety-management skill (incident log, near-miss reports)
- **Daily Site Observations** from daily-report-format (housekeeping notes, PPE compliance)
- **Toolbox Talk Log** from safety procedures (attendance by crew)
- **OSHA Records** (citations, inspections)
- **Safety Audit Scores** from project-wide safety audits

#### Calculation

```
Safety Score = Base (0-10) adjusted by incident severity and pattern analysis
```

**Example (MOSC):**
- Walker Construction: Zero recordables, 1 near-miss (remediated), toolbox talks 100%, housekeeping 95%, PPE compliance 100%, certs current = 10
- Davis & Plomin (HVAC): Zero recordables, zero near-misses, toolbox talks 95%, housekeeping good, PPE compliance 95%, certs current = 9 → Score: 9

- Frequent incomplete submissions; multiple follow-ups required
- Communication poor; difficult to reach, vague responses
- Slow issue resolution; delays cascade to downstream work

**>14 Day RFI Response + >14 Day Submittal = 2**
- RFI responses >14 days or no response without escalation
- Submittals overdue; extended back-and-forth delays
- Consistently incomplete submissions; requires constant chasing
- Communication unreliable; poor responsiveness
- Issues unresolved for weeks; impacts project schedule

#### Data Sources

- **RFI Log** from rfi-preparer skill (date issued → date answered, tracked per trade)
- **Submittal Tracking** from submittal-intelligence skill (date received → date approved, by supplier)
- **Communication Records** (email response times, meeting attendance, call logs)
- **Issue Resolution Log** (tickets opened → closed, time-to-resolve)

#### Calculation

```
Responsiveness Score = (RFI response time score 1-10) + (Submittal turnaround score 1-10) / 2
+ (Communication quality manual score 1-10) / 3
```

**Example (MOSC):**
- Schiller (Doors/Hardware): RFI avg 12 days, submittal avg 24 days (OVERDUE), communication poor = 3 + 2 + 2 / 3 ≈ 2.3 → Score: 2
- Alexander (PEMB): RFI avg 2 days, submittal avg 4 days, communication clear, proactive = 10 + 10 + 9 / 3 ≈ 9.7 → Score: 10

## Composite Score Calculation

Once all five dimensions are scored 1-10, combine using this weighted formula:

```
COMPOSITE SCORE = (Schedule × 0.25) + (Quality × 0.25) + (Safety × 0.20)
                  + (Responsiveness × 0.15) + (Professionalism × 0.15)
```

### Rating Scale

| Composite Score | Rating | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9.0-10.0 | **Excellent** | Preferred Bidder | Recognition, incentives, preferred bid list |
| 7.0-8.9 | **Good** | Standard Operations | Continue; monitor annually |
| 5.0-6.9 | **Needs Improvement** | At Risk | Performance meeting; improvement plan; increased monitoring |
| <5.0 | **At Risk** | Critical | Formal corrective action; contract review; potential termination |
