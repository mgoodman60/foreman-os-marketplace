# Quantitative Intelligence

## Overview

A calculation bridge that connects all measurement sources to the project intelligence data store, with a complete cross-sheet reference index enabling multi-page calculations and spatial correlations.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Builds a Sheet Cross-Reference Index** — Maps every detail callout, section cut, schedule reference, and spec reference across the entire plan set so Claude knows how sheets connect
2. **Creates Assembly Chains** — Links related elements across multiple sheets (e.g., footing plan view → section detail → structural notes → concrete spec) into calculation chains
3. **Calculates Derived Quantities** — Computes volumes, areas, lengths, and counts by pulling dimensions from multiple sheets through assembly chains
4. **Merges Multiple Data Sources** — Combines DXF geometry (exact), visual analysis (approximate), takeoff measurements (calibrated), and text extraction (parsed) with clear priority rules
5. **Flags Discrepancies** — When sources disagree by >10%, flags for superintendent review
6. **Stores in Project Intelligence** — All quantities go into `plans-spatial.json` with source attribution for downstream use by reports, dashboards, and briefs

## Data Source Priority

When the same measurement exists from multiple sources, use the highest-priority source and note others as validation:

| Priority | Source | Accuracy | When Available |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| 1 (highest) | DXF geometry | Exact coordinates | .dxf files processed through Phase 6 parse_dxf.py |
| 2 | Visual analysis | ±5-10% | Plan sheet images processed through Phase 7 visual_plan_analyzer.py |
| 3 | Takeoff measurement | ±2-5% (calibrated) | Scale-calibrated measurements from construction-takeoff skill |
| 4 (lowest) | Text extraction | Varies | Values parsed from PDF text, notes, schedules |

**Discrepancy Rule**: When any two sources disagree by >10%, flag for review. The superintendent resolves discrepancies — Claude does not auto-resolve.

## Integration with construction-takeoff Cowork Skill

For plan-based quantity extraction, the `construction-takeoff` Cowork skill provides an alternative or complementary workflow. When a takeoff is performed using that skill, its calibrated measurements feed directly into the Data Source Priority system at Priority Level 3. If the construction-takeoff skill detects quantities that differ from DXF or visual analysis results by >10%, it triggers the discrepancy flag for superintendent review. This integration enables both tools to work together: quantitative-intelligence for cross-sheet assembly chains and derived calculations, and construction-takeoff for focused material-by-material measurement and cost rollups.

## Assembly Chains

An assembly chain links every piece of information about a single construction element across all sheets where it appears. Chains are the foundation for multi-page calculations.

### Chain Structure

Each chain has:
- **Element identifier** (e.g., "Footing F1", "Wall Type 2A", "RTU-1")
- **Links** — ordered list of sheets and what data each provides
- **Calculated values** — derived from combining all link data
- **Source priority** — which source provided each value

### Common Chain Types

| Chain Type | Typical Links | Calculates |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Footing** | Foundation plan → footing detail → structural notes → spec | Volume (CY), rebar weight (lbs), form area (SF) |
| **Wall** | Floor plan (length) → building section (height) → wall type legend (assembly) → spec | Total LF, total SF, GWB SF, insulation SF, stud count |
| **Room** | Floor plan (boundary) → finish schedule (materials) → RCP (ceiling) → spec | Area SF, perimeter LF, wall SF, ceiling SF, flooring SF |
| **SOG** | Floor plan (area) → structural notes (thickness) → spec (concrete) | Area SF, volume CY, vapor barrier SF, rebar/WWF qty |
| **Roof** | Roof plan (area) → building section (slope/assembly) → spec (roofing) | Area SF (flat), area SF (sloped), insulation SF |
| **PEMB column** | PEMB reaction drawing → foundation plan → anchor bolt layout → erection plan | Reaction loads, anchor bolt spec, tributary area |
| **Pipe run** | Plumbing plan sheet 1 + sheet 2 + ... → riser diagram → spec | Total LF by size, fitting count, hanger count |
| **Equipment** | MEP plan (location) → equipment schedule (specs) → spec (requirements) | Count, capacity, electrical requirements, clearances |

### Building Chains Automatically

1. Start from a **known element** (room number, footing mark, equipment tag)
2. Look up all **cross-references** in the index that mention this element
3. Follow each reference to its **target sheet**
4. Extract the **relevant data** from each linked sheet
5. Assemble the chain and **calculate derived quantities**

### Assembly Chain Impact from Non-Plan Documents

When `/process-docs` processes RFI responses, submittal approvals, or change orders that reference specific plan elements:

- The affected assembly chain should be marked with `needs_verification: true`
- The verification note should reference the source document: "RFI-003 response may affect Footing F1 assembly chain — rebar callout clarified"
- On the next plan processing run, chains marked `needs_verification` are rebuilt first
- This prevents quantity data from becoming stale when clarifications arrive via non-plan documents

## Calculation Capabilities

### Initial vs Incremental Quantity Processing

- **First run** (no existing quantities): Build the full quantity baseline. Extract all measurable elements, create all assembly chains, and establish source attribution for every value. Note in output: "Initial quantity baseline established — X elements tracked across Y sheets."
- **Incremental** (quantities already exist): Only recalculate quantities affected by newly processed sheets. Preserve existing chains and only rebuild where new data touches them. Cross-verify new values against existing ones.

### Concrete Volumes

From structural details — DXF polylines provide exact footing outlines; visual dimensions provide depth from structural notes.

| Element | Formula | Sources |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Footings | L × W × D per footing × count | Foundation plan + footing detail |
| SOG | Area × thickness | Floor plan + structural notes |
| Grade beams | L × W × D | Foundation plan + detail |
| Piers | π × r² × D or L × W × D | Foundation plan + detail |
| Walls | L × H × T | Floor plan + building section |
| Curbs | L × W × H | Site plan + detail |

Always add waste factor: 5% for formed elements, 10% for footings (over-excavation), 3% for SOG.

### Room Areas and Perimeters

From DXF closed polylines (exact) or visual measurements (approximate) or dimension annotations on plans.

- **Area**: Shoelace formula on polyline vertices (DXF), or pixel counting at calibrated scale (visual)
- **Perimeter**: Sum of polyline segment lengths (DXF), or boundary tracing (visual)
- **Wall area**: Perimeter × ceiling height (from building section or room elevation)
- **Ceiling area**: Same as floor area (flat ceiling) or calculated from section (sloped/vaulted)

### Material Quantities by CSI Division

Aggregate individual items into division totals:

- **Division 03**: Total CY of concrete by mix type, total tons of rebar by grade
- **Division 05**: Total tons of structural steel, total LF of miscellaneous metals
- **Division 07**: Total SF of roofing, insulation, waterproofing, sealant LF
- **Division 08**: Door count by type, hardware set count, window count by type
- **Division 09**: Flooring SF by type, GWB SF, ceiling SF by type, paint SF
- **Division 22**: Fixture count by type, pipe LF by size, valve count
- **Division 23**: Equipment count, ductwork LF/SF, diffuser count
- **Division 26**: Panel count, outlet count by type, switch count, light fixture count

### PEMB-Specific Quantities

- **Tributary areas** per column (bay spacing × frame spacing)
- **Bay areas** (length × width per bay)
- **Wall panel SF** (eave height × perimeter, minus openings)
- **Roof panel SF** (ridge length × slope length × 2 sides)
- **Gutter LF** (eave length, both sides)
- **Downspout count** (typically 1 per 40-50 LF of gutter)

### Flooring by Type

Total SF of each flooring material from finish schedule + room areas + visual zone detection:

1. Read finish schedule for room → flooring material mapping
2. Look up room area from quantities.rooms
3. Sum by material type
4. Cross-check against visual material zone detection (Phase 7)
5. Flag discrepancies >10%

### Symbol Counts

Total fixture/device counts from visual detection, validated against schedule counts:

1. Visual Pass 4 detects symbols on plan sheets
2. Aggregate counts across all plan sheets (avoid double-counting on overlapping sheets)
3. Compare against schedule counts (door schedule, fixture schedule, panel schedule)
4. Flag discrepancies — schedule count is authoritative; visual count validates

## Integration with Downstream Skills

### /morning-brief
When the morning brief mentions today's work areas, include relevant quantities:
- "Room 007 Therapy: 450 SF VCT flooring, 86 LF vinyl base"
- "Footings at Grid C-3 through D-5: 12.4 CY concrete (4,000 PSI), #5@12" E.W."
- "22 duplex outlets remaining in East Wing (63 of 85 installed = 74%)"

### /daily-report
When daily reports reference work completed, enable percentage calculations:
- "Completed VCT in Rooms 007-009: 1,240 SF of 4,800 SF total (26%)"
- "Poured Footings F1-F4: 9.5 CY of 42.3 CY total footings (22%)"
- "Installed 15 duplex outlets in Rooms 101-108 (East Wing: 63/85 = 74%)"

### /look-ahead
When generating lookahead schedules, include material quantities for upcoming activities:
- "Week 2: SOG pour Area B — 156 CY concrete needed, 4 trucks at 40 CY/day"
- "Week 3: VCT installation Rooms 201-215 — 3,200 SF, ~4 days at 800 SF/day"

### /project-dashboard
Quantity summary section showing:
- Total quantities by CSI division
- Percent complete by material type (installed / total)
- Discrepancy log with resolution status
- Source attribution breakdown (what % from DXF, visual, takeoff, text)

---

## Workflow

### Initial Quantity Extraction (during /set-project or /process-docs)

1. **Build drawing index** from sheet list (sheet numbers, titles, disciplines)
2. **Build cross-reference index** from text + visual + DXF extraction results
3. **Identify assembly chains** by tracing cross-references for key elements
4. **Calculate quantities** using assembly chains + data from all sources
5. **Flag discrepancies** where sources disagree >10%
6. **Store in config** under `plans-spatial.json` `quantities` and `sheet_cross_references`
7. **Report summary** to superintendent for validation

### Incremental Updates (when new documents added)

1. **Read existing index** from config
2. **Process new document** through extraction pipeline
3. **Update index** with new cross-references
4. **Recalculate affected chains** (only chains linked to new/changed sheets)
5. **Update quantities** and flag new discrepancies
6. **Report changes** to superintendent

### On-Demand Queries

When the superintendent asks a quantity question:

1. **Check stored quantities** in config
2. **If available**: Return with source attribution and confidence
3. **If not available**: Build assembly chain on-the-fly, calculate, store, return
4. **If discrepancy exists**: Present both values, ask for resolution

## Cross-Verification — Checking Your Work Across Sheets

The same data point often appears on multiple sheets. This is intentional — construction documents are redundant by design. Use this redundancy to **verify accuracy and build confidence** in extracted values.

### The Verification Principle

**Every critical measurement should be confirmed from at least two independent sources.** When two sources agree, confidence is HIGH. When they disagree, flag for review — one of them is wrong (or the drawings have a coordination error the super needs to know about).

### What to Cross-Check and Where

| Data Point | Primary Source | Verification Source(s) | How to Check |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Pipe length** | Plan view (measured centerline) | Profile view (station-to-station distances) | Plan LF should match profile station difference |
| **Pipe size** | Plan view (label on pipe) | Profile view (pipe schedule), Plumbing schedule | All three should match |
| **Pipe invert elevation** | Profile view (invert table) | Plan view (spot elevation at manholes) | Profile inverts should match plan spot elevations |
| **Footing size** | Foundation plan (dimensions) | Footing detail (cross-section dims) | Plan L×W should match detail L×W; detail adds depth |
| **Concrete strength** | Structural general notes | Spec Section 03 30 00 | Must match — if not, spec governs per most contracts |
| **Room area** | Floor plan (scaled or dimensioned) | Finish schedule (if area column exists) | Should match within 5% |
| **Door size** | Door schedule | Door detail (if exists) | Must match — schedule is authoritative |
| **Equipment capacity** | Equipment schedule | Equipment detail/spec sheet | Must match — schedule is design intent |
| **Building dimensions** | Floor plan outer dimension string | Site plan building footprint | Must match |
| **Finish floor elevation** | Architectural floor plan (FFE) | Civil grading plan (pad + slab thickness) | Pad elev + slab thickness should = FFE |
| **Ceiling height** | Room finish schedule | Building section (floor-to-ceiling dim) | Must match |
| **Grid spacing** | Foundation plan (dimension strings) | Framing plan (dimension strings) | Must match exactly — this is the structural skeleton |
| **Slab thickness** | Structural notes (typical thickness) | Building section (shown in section) | Must match |
| **Rebar size/spacing** | Structural detail (shown in section) | Structural notes (listed by element) | Must match |
| **Wall assembly** | Wall type legend/schedule | Building section (shown in section) | Layers and thickness must match |

### Grading Plan Cross-Verification

Grading plans are a special case because **existing and proposed grades are always on separate sheets** (or separate line types on the same sheet):

1. **Existing grade** — From survey/topo sheet (C-001 or C-100 series), shown as dashed contours
2. **Proposed grade** — From grading plan (C-200 series or same sheet), shown as solid contours
3. **Cut/fill calculation** requires overlaying BOTH — at every point, subtract existing from proposed
4. **Verify FFE** — The proposed grade at the building pad should be consistent with the FFE on architectural plans minus slab thickness minus subbase
5. **Verify drainage** — Proposed contours should show water flowing AWAY from the building (grade drops away from FFE in all directions)

**Verification formula:**
```
FFE (Arch) = Pad Elevation (Civil) + Subbase Thickness + Slab Thickness
```
If this doesn't check out, there's a coordination error between civil and architectural.

### Dimension String Verification

Dimension strings contain built-in cross-checks:

```
|←— 12'-0" —→|←— 30'-0" —→|←— 30'-0" —→|←— 12'-0" —→|
|←————————————————— 84'-0" ————————————————————————→|
```

**Check:** Do the individual dimensions sum to the overall dimension?
- 12 + 30 + 30 + 12 = 84 ✓

If they don't match, the drawings have an error. Flag it — this is exactly the kind of thing a superintendent needs to catch before construction.

### Confidence Scoring

After cross-verification, assign confidence based on how many sources agree:

| Sources Checked | Agreement | Confidence Level |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 3+ sources, all agree | Full agreement | **VERIFIED** — high confidence |
| 2 sources, agree | Agreement | **CONFIRMED** — good confidence |
| 2 sources, within 5% | Minor variance | **LIKELY CORRECT** — acceptable for estimation |
| 2 sources, 5-10% apart | Moderate variance | **CHECK** — may be rounding or scale measurement error |
| 2 sources, >10% apart | Major discrepancy | **DISCREPANCY** — flag for superintendent review |
| 1 source only | No verification | **UNVERIFIED** — use with caution, note in output |
